	abstract = {Liberals claim that globalization has led to fragmentation and decentralized networks of
power relations. This does not explain how states increasingly “weaponize interdependence”
by leveraging global networks of informational and financial exchange for strategic
advantage. The theoretical literature on network topography shows how standard models
predict that many networks grow asymmetrically so that some nodes are far more connected
than others. This model nicely describes several key global economic networks, centering
on the United States and a few other states. Highly asymmetric networks allow states with
(1) effective jurisdiction over the central economic nodes and (2) appropriate domestic
institutions and norms to weaponize these structural advantages for coercive ends. In
particular, two mechanisms can be identified. First, states can employ the “panopticon
effect” to gather strategically valuable information. Second, they can employ the
“chokepoint effect” to deny network access to adversaries. Tests of the plausibility of
these arguments across two extended case studies that provide variation both in the extent
of U.S. jurisdiction and in the presence of domestic institutions—the SWIFT financial
messaging system and the internet—confirm the framework's expectations. A better
understanding of the policy implications of the use and potential overuse of these tools,
as well as the response strategies of targeted states, will recast scholarly debates on
the relationship between economic globalization and state coercion.},

	abstract = {Since the 2010s, China has used economic coercion against Western and Asian
states to achieve territorial and political goals. China's leveraging of
its market is a form of “predatory liberalism” that weaponizes the
networks of interdependence created by globalization. The United States and
other like-minded partners have mostly used piecemeal “de-risking”
measures such as decoupling, supply chain resilience, reshoring, and trade
diversion to reduce dependence on China and thereby minimize vulnerability to
its economic coercion. But these practices do not stop the Chinese
government's economic bullying. “Collective resilience” is
a peer competition strategy designed to deter the Xi Jinping regime's
economic predation. What informs this strategy is the understanding that
interdependence, even asymmetric interdependence, is a two-way street. Original
trade data show that the previous and current targets of economic coercion by
the Xi Jinping regime export over \$46.6 billion worth of goods to China
on which it is more than 70 percent dependent as a proportion of its total
imports of those goods. These target states could band together in a collective
resilience alliance and practice economic deterrence by promising to retaliate
against China's high-dependence trade should Beijing act against any one
of the alliance members.},

While cryptocurrencies have received much attention, the implications of DLT are potentially far reaching. DLT raises interesting and important questions relating to rules of evidence, surrounding issues like hearsay and authentication. The advent of initial coin offerings has implications not only for how firms are financed but also for securities law in regulating such offerings. Cryptocurrencies themselves (e.g., Bitcoin) have raised serious issues for tax avoidance and taxation law. Relatedly, the rise of cryptocurrencies raises issues regarding the relationship between private and nationally issued currencies, and even the role and efficacy of monetary policy. Finally, DLT has practical implications for election law and voter turnout, with such technology already begun to be used for security purposes in online voting and permitted in 32 US states.},

            We provide evidence that financial market risk perceptions are important drivers of economic fluctuations. We introduce a novel measure of risk perceptions: the price of volatile stocks (PVSt), defined as the book-to-market ratio of low-volatility stocks minus the book-to-market ratio of high-volatility stocks. PVSt is high when perceived risk directly measured from surveys and option prices is low. Using our measure, we show that high perceived risk is associated with low risk-free interest rates, a high cost of capital for risky firms, and future declines in output and real investment. Perceived risk as measured by PVSt falls after positive macroeconomic news. These declines are predictably followed by upward revisions in perceived risk, indicating that fluctuations in investor risk perceptions are not fully rational.},

Europe in the year 1400: The dark middle ages, once dominated by nobles and the clergy, came to an end and a new era begins: the age of free, prospering cities, trading and an open mind-set! One of the goals in the The Guild series is to create a family dynasty which can last for centuries. 

While the world around you and your dynasty rearranges itself time and time again – all non-player characters (NPCs) make their own decisions –, you have to prove your skills in artisan craftwork and trading, participate in social occasions and perfect your political schemes and malicious intrigues.

	abstract = {The United States is facing exceptional challenges to our democracy. Lee Drutman, Senior Fellow in the Political Reform Program at the New America Foundation, thinks that our two-party system is a root cause of that dysfunction. Although we have had a two-party system in name for many decades, there were divisions and overlaps between parties that created room for bargaining, compromise, crossing over, and even unity. In our current state of hyper-polarization, however, the two parties are fully sorted, and this give-and-take has eroded into a death-match. According to Drutman, our democracy will not succeed unless we can escape this two-party doom loop. 

In this talk, Drutman and Archon Fung, Winthrop Laflin McCormack Professor of Citizenship and Self-Government, will discuss our two-party system and potential strategies for a critical, non-incremental move away from our dysfunctional "politics as usual."},

He spent much of his career at the University of Chicago, where he served as department chair immediately prior to his departure for Princeton.  He is best known for his work in mathematical economics (particularly dynamic optimization) and finance, oligopoly theory and the social economics of cities and crime; he also helped spur the development of work at the intersection of economics, finance and physics. Scheinkman also famously pioneered the now-ubiquitous application of academic financial theory to practical risk management of fixed incomes during a leave he took as Vice President in the Financial Strategies Group at Goldman, Sachs \& Co. during the late 1980s.},

	abstract = {Edward Ludwig "Ed"  Glaeser (born May 1, 1967) is an American economist and Fred and Eleanor Glimp Professor of Economics at Harvard University. He is also Director for the Cities Research Programme at the International Growth Centre.
He was educated at The Collegiate School in New York City before obtaining his A.B. in economics from Princeton University and his Ph.D. in economics from the University of Chicago. Glaeser joined the faculty of Harvard in 1992, where he is currently (as of January 2018) the Fred and Eleanor Glimp Professor at the Department of Economics. He previously served as the Director of the Taubman Center for State and Local Government and the Director of the Rappaport Institute for Greater Boston (both at the Kennedy School of Government).  He is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, and a contributing editor of City Journal. He was also an editor of the Quarterly Journal of Economics.  Glaeser and John A. List were mentioned as reasons why the AEA committee began to award the Clark Medal annually in 2009.
According to a review in The New York Times, his book titled Triumph of the City: How Our Greatest Invention Makes Us Richer, Smarter, Greener, Healthier, and Happier (2011) summarizes Glaeser's years of research into the role that cities play in fostering human achievement and "is at once polymathic and vibrant".},

	abstract = {In the wake of Trump’s election to the US presidency, the “losers” from globalization have received unprecedented attention. While few would contest that manufacturing workers in developed countries have lost out over the past decades, the remedies proposed by President Trump have been met with a mixture of concern and ridicule by the trade establishment. And yet, it seems clear that, at least in the United States, politicians and trade officials are no longer able to convince voters that international economic agreements will “lift all boats”. Instead, those engaged in debates about trade policy will need to be open about the fact that international economic agreements create both winners and losers. The article identifies three narratives about who those winners and losers are. The article argues that the contestation between these three narratives is not one that can be resolved through empirical analysis, but that the narratives instead contain irreducible normative elements. The article further explores the implications of these narratives for the redesign of international economic agreements.},

	abstract = {Economic concepts and techniques presented through a series of "big questions," models that show how to pose a questions rigorously and work toward an answer.
                This book helps readers master economic concepts and techniques by tackling fundamental economic and political questions through a series of models. It is organized around a sequence of “big questions,” among them: When do markets help translate individuals' uncoordinated, selfish actions into outcomes that are best for all? Do markets change people, and, if so, for worse or better? Translated into the language of modern economics, do Marx's ideas have merit? Why is there so much income inequality? Or is there too little?  The arguments are in the theorem-proof format, distinguishing results derived in the context of fully specified models from educated speculation. Readers will learn how to pose a question rigorously and how to work toward an answer, and to appreciate that even (especially!) the broadest and most ambitious questions call for a model. The goal of the book is not to indoctrinate but to show readers how to reason toward their own conclusions.The first chapter, on the Walrasian model of general equilibrium, serves as the prerequisite for the rest of the book. The remaining chapters cover less conventional topics, including the morality of markets; matching theory; Marxism, socialism, and the resilience of markets; a formalization of Kant's categorical imperative; unintended consequences of policy design; and theories of justice. The book can be used as a textbook for advanced undergraduate or graduate students or as a resource for researchers in disciplines that draw on normative economics.},

	abstract = {This paper tests for the presence of adverse selection in thoroughbred yearling auction markets. Thoroughbred auctions consist of two seller types: sellers who breed horses to race and sell (racers) and sellers who take all their yearlings to auction (breeders). If racers use private information, keeping those yearlings with a higher probability of on-track success, they are likely to receive a lower price for similar yearlings as compared to breeders. Using data from Keeneland's 1994 September yearling sale, we find support for this hypothesis. We improve on previous studies by analyzing the distinction between seller types on a continuous scale.},

	abstract = {Several studies (Genesove 1993; Chezum and Wimmer 1997) use evidence of a correlation between seller characteristics and prices as evidence of adverse selection. This approach ignores the effect seller effort might have on the quality of goods sold. We develop a theoretical framework that accounts for both adverse selection and seller effort and provide a set of conditions under which sellers, who more likely adversely select the goods they sell, produce higher quality goods. Empirically, adverse selection emerges as a special case of selection bias. To disentangle the effects of adverse selection from seller effort, we employ a unique data set that allows us to model the selection decision explicitly. The evidence suggests that both adverse selection and hidden effort play important roles in the market for thoroughbred racehorse prospects.},

As a specialization of risk management, financial risk management focuses on when and how to hedge using financial instruments to manage costly exposures to risk.In the banking sector worldwide, the Basel Accords are generally adopted by internationally active banks for tracking, reporting and exposing operational, credit and market risks.},

	abstract = {Skin serves as the first protective line and barrier of the body. Like many other organs, skin can be affected by several disorders in response to external factors such as pathogens, ultraviolet light, and pollution, as well as endogenous alterations related to aging and/or oxidative stress disturbance. Researchers have reported new insights into how skin cells are altered in response to caloric restriction diets in mammals. One of the most well-known caloric restriction diets is the Ramadan intermittent fasting, which is a radical change in the diet plan of practitioners for the period of one lunar month. Ramadan fasting represents the fourth of the five pillars of the Islamic creed. Even though infirm individuals are waived to take part in this religious duty, patients with various health problems, including those with different skin disorders, might choose to share this event with peers and family members. No standardized protocols or guidelines exist, however, to advise their physicians on the proper management of their patients’ condition during fasting. With an increasing Muslim population living in Western countries, this topic has started to draw substantial attention, not only of Middle-Eastern physicians, but also of clinicians in the West. For this purpose, we carried out a comprehensive overview on the topic. Our main findings are that: (1) there is a strong need for evidence-based suggestions and guidance. Literature on the impact of the Ramadan fasting, as well as of other kinds of fasting, on skin diseases is scarce and of poor quality, as well as the information available from the Internet; (2) patients willing to fast should be advised about the importance of taking proper treatments or consider alternative options including administration of trans-dermal/topical drugs, as they are permitted during daylight hours. Further, non-compliance has important, clinical and economic implications for an effective patient management.},

Studies from recent years, however, have made it clear that diet may influence outcome. In this review, the authors focus on conditions for which the role of diet has traditionally been an underappreciated aspect of therapy. In some cases, dietary interventions may influence the course of the skin disease, as in acne. In others, dietary change may serve as one aspect of prevention, such as in skin cancer and aging of the skin. In others, dermatological disease may be linked to systemic disease, and dietary changes may affect health outcomes, as in psoriasis. Lastly, systemic medications prescribed for dermatological disease, such as steroids, are known to raise the risk of other diseases, and dietary change may reduce this risk.},

	abstract = {The Minnesota Starvation Experiment, also known as the Minnesota Semi-Starvation Experiment, the Minnesota Starvation-Recovery Experiment and the Starvation Study, was a clinical study performed at the University of Minnesota between November 19, 1944 and December 20, 1945. The investigation was designed to determine the physiological and psychological effects of severe and prolonged dietary restriction and the effectiveness of dietary rehabilitation strategies.
The motivation of the study was twofold: first, to produce a definitive treatise on the subject of human starvation based on a laboratory simulation of severe famine and, second, to use the scientific results produced to guide the Allied relief assistance to famine victims in Europe and Asia at the end of World War II. It was recognized early in 1944 that millions of people were in grave danger of mass famine as a result of the conflict, and information was needed regarding the effects of semi-starvation—and the impact of various rehabilitation strategies—if postwar relief efforts were to be effective.
The study was developed in coordination with the Civilian Public Service (CPS) and the Selective Service System and used 36 men selected from a pool of over 200 CPS volunteers.The study was divided into three phases: A twelve-week control phase, where physiological and psychological observations were collected to establish a baseline for each subject; a 24-week starvation phase, during which the caloric intake of each subject was drastically reduced—causing each participant to lose an average of 25\% of their pre-starvation body weight; and finally a recovery phase, in which various rehabilitative diets were tried to re-nourish the volunteers. Two subjects were dismissed for failing to maintain the dietary restrictions imposed during the starvation phase of the experiment, and the data for two others were not used in the analysis of the results.
In 1950, Ancel Keys and his colleagues published the results of the Minnesota Starvation Experiment in a two-volume, 1,385 page text entitled The Biology of Human Starvation (University of Minnesota Press). While this definitive treatise came too late to substantially impact postwar recovery efforts, preliminary pamphlets containing key results from the Minnesota Starvation Experiment were produced and used extensively by aid workers in Europe and Asia in the months following the cessation of hostilities.},

This may be partly due to the the greater amount of adipose tissue in women and the preferential use of fat rather than lean tissue as fuel during starvation. These gender-speciﬁc fuel mobilisation patterns during starvation may provide evolutionary advantages to the females.},

	doi = {10.1080/02640414.2011.619204},
	abstract = {Opinion on the role of protein in promoting athletic performance is divided along the lines of how much aerobic-based versus resistance-based activity the athlete undertakes. Athletes seeking to gain muscle mass and strength are likely to consume higher amounts of dietary protein than their endurance-trained counterparts. The main belief behind the large quantities of dietary protein consumption in resistance-trained athletes is that it is needed to generate more muscle protein. Athletes may require protein for more than just alleviation of the risk for deficiency, inherent in the dietary guidelines, but also to aid in an elevated level of functioning and possibly adaptation to the exercise stimulus. It does appear, however, that there is a good rationale for recommending to athletes protein intakes that are higher than the RDA. Our consensus opinion is that leucine, and possibly the other branched-chain amino acids, occupy a position of prominence in stimulating muscle protein synthesis; that protein intakes in the range of 1.3-1.8 g · kg(-1) · day(-1) consumed as 3-4 isonitrogenous meals will maximize muscle protein synthesis. These recommendations may also be dependent on training status: experienced athletes would require less, while more protein should be consumed during periods of high frequency/intensity training. Elevated protein consumption, as high as 1.8-2.0 g · kg(-1) · day(-1) depending on the caloric deficit, may be advantageous in preventing lean mass losses during periods of energy restriction to promote fat loss.},

	abstract = {There has been debate among athletes and nutritionists regarding dietary protein needs for centuries. Although contrary to traditional belief, recent scientific information collected on physically active individuals tends to indicate that regular exercise increases daily protein requirements; however, the precise details remain to be worked out. Based on laboratory measures, daily protein requirements are increased by perhaps as much as 100\% vs. recommendations for sedentary individuals (1.6-1.8 vs. 0.8 g/kg). Yet even these intakes are much less than those reported by most athletes. This may mean that actual requirements are below what is needed to optimize athletic performance, and so the debate continues. Numerous interacting factors including energy intake, carbohydrate availability, exercise intensity, duration and type, dietary protein quality, training history, gender, age, timing of nutrient intake and the like make this topic extremely complex. Many questions remain to be resolved. At the present time, substantial data indicate that the current recommended protein intake should be adjusted upward for those who are physically active, especially in populations whose needs are elevated for other reasons, e.g., growing individuals, dieters, vegetarians, individuals with muscle disease-induced weakness and the elderly. For these latter groups, specific supplementation may be appropriate, but for most North Americans who consume a varied diet, including complete protein foods (meat, eggs, fish and dairy products), and sufficient energy the increased protein needs induced by a regular exercise program can be met in one's diet.},

	abstract = {Strength training is an important component in sports training and rehabilitation. Quantification of the dose-response relationships between training variables and the outcome is fundamental for the proper prescription of resistance training. The purpose of this comprehensive review was to identify dose-response relationships for the development of muscle hypertrophy by calculating the magnitudes and rates of increases in muscle cross-sectional area induced by varying levels of frequency, intensity and volume, as well as by different modes of strength training. Computer searches in the databases MEDLINE, SportDiscus and CINAHL were performed as well as hand searches of relevant journals, books and reference lists. The analysis was limited to the quadriceps femoris and the elbow flexors, since these were the only muscle groups that allowed for evaluations of dose-response trends. The modes of strength training were classified as dynamic external resistance (including free weights and weight machines), accommodating resistance (e.g. isokinetic and semi-isokinetic devices) and isometric resistance. The subcategories related to the types of muscle actions used. The results demonstrate that given sufficient frequency, intensity and volume of work, all three types of muscle actions can induce significant hypertrophy at an impressive rate and that, at present, there is insufficient evidence for the superiority of any mode and/or type of muscle action over other modes and types of training. Tentative dose-response relationships for each variable are outlined, based on the available evidence, and interactions between variables are discussed. In addition, recommendations for training and suggestions for further research are given.},

	abstract = {There has been a proliferation in recent scholarly discussion regarding the scientific validity of single vs. multiple sets of resistance training (dose) to optimize muscular strength development (response). Recent meta-analytical research indicates that there exist distinct muscular adaptations, and dose-response relationships, that correspond to certain populations. It seems that training status influences the requisite doses as well as the potential magnitude of response. Specifically, for individuals seeking to experience muscular strength development beyond that of general health, an increase in resistance-training dosage must accompany increases in training experience. The purpose of this document is to analyze and apply the findings of 2 meta-analytical investigations that identified dose-response relationships for 3 populations: previously untrained, recreationally trained, and athlete; and thereby reveal distinct, quantified, dose-response trends for each population segment. Two meta-analytical investigations, consisting of 177 studies and 1,803 effect sizes (ES) were examined to extract the dose-response continuums for intensity, frequency, volume of training, and the resultant strength increases, specific to each population. ES data demonstrate unique dose-response relationships per population. For untrained individuals, maximal strength gains are elicited at a mean training intensity of 60\% of 1 repetition maximum (1RM), 3 days per week, and with a mean training volume of 4 sets per muscle group. Recreationally trained nonathletes exhibit maximal strength gains with a mean training intensity of 80\% of 1RM, 2 days per week, and a mean volume of 4 sets. For athlete populations, maximal strength gains are elicited at a mean training intensity of 85\% of 1RM, 2 days per week, and with a mean training volume of 8 sets per muscle group. These meta-analyses demonstrate that the effort-to-benefit ratio is different for untrained, recreationally trained, and athlete populations; thus, emphasizing the necessity of appropriate exercise prescription to optimize training effect. Exercise professionals may apply these dose-response trends to prescribe appropriate, goal-oriented training programs.},

Subjects were tested pre- and poststudy for 1 repetition maximum strength in the bench press and squat, and muscle thickness (MT) of forearm flexors, forearm extensors, and vastus lateralis. Results showed significantly greater increases in forearm flexor MT for TOTAL compared with SPLIT. No significant differences were noted in maximal strength measures.

	abstract = {This investigation compared the effect of high-volume (VOL) versus high-intensity (INT) resistance training on stimulating changes in muscle size and strength in resistance-trained men. Following a 2-week preparatory phase, participants were randomly assigned to either a high-volume (VOL; n = 14, 4 × 10–12 repetitions with ∼70\% of one repetition maximum [1RM], 1-min rest intervals) or a high-intensity (INT; n = 15, 4 × 3–5 repetitions with ∼90\% of 1RM, 3-min rest intervals) training group for 8 weeks. Pre- and posttraining assessments included lean tissue mass via dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, muscle cross-sectional area and thickness of the vastus lateralis (VL), rectus femoris (RF), pectoralis major, and triceps brachii muscles via ultrasound images, and 1RM strength in the back squat and bench press (BP) exercises. Blood samples were collected at baseline, immediately post, 30 min post, and 60 min postexercise at week 3 (WK3) and week 10 (WK10) to assess the serum testosterone, growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1), cortisol, and insulin concentrations. Compared to VOL, greater improvements (P {\textless} 0.05) in lean arm mass (5.2 ± 2.9\% vs. 2.2 ± 5.6\%) and 1RM BP (14.8 ± 9.7\% vs. 6.9 ± 9.0\%) were observed for INT. Compared to INT, area under the curve analysis revealed greater (P {\textless} 0.05) GH and cortisol responses for VOL at WK3 and cortisol only at WK10. Compared to WK3, the GH and cortisol responses were attenuated (P {\textless} 0.05) for VOL at WK10, while the IGF1 response was reduced (P {\textless} 0.05) for INT. It appears that high-intensity resistance training stimulates greater improvements in some measures of strength and hypertrophy in resistance-trained men during a short-term training period.},

	abstract = {Skin changes are common in patients on dialysis. This study focused on putative associations of specific skin findings with comorbidities and mortality., We performed a retrospective analysis of data from 508 patients on maintenance hemodialysis therapy in 7 centers in the German State of North Rhine Westphalia. Data had been collected by interview, from patient files, and from targeted physical examination in an earlier prospective study screening hemodialysis patients for the presence of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. While on dialysis, patients’ extremities had been examined for any of the following: edematous skin at the lower extremities, hyperpigmentation, induration, and xerosis cutis. Our present data analyses focused on associated mortality and comorbidities., Five hundred eight patients (median age 71 years, range 20.0–95.9; n = 292 men) had agreed to participate in the initial study: 48\% (n = 243) were diabetics and 46\% (n = 232) had been diagnosed with coronary heart disease. On examination, 86\% of patients (n = 439) presented with at least 1 of the prespecified skin changes. Skin edema (n = 89; 18\%), hyperpigmentation (n = 74; 15\%), and induration (n = 9; 2\%) were independently associated with increased mortality over 24 months (P {\textless} 0.002, P {\textless} 0.030, and P {\textless} 0.020, respectively)., In our study, prespecified skin changes indicated an increased mortality risk in patients on chronic hemodialysis. Routinely assessing the skin of dialysis patients represents a simple, reliable, and cost effective means of identifying those at greatest risk.},

	abstract = {The Cerrado is one of the world’s biodiversity hotspots. In the last 35 years, more than 50\% of its approximately 2 million km2 has been transformed into pasture and agricultural lands planted in cash crops. The Cerrado has the richest flora among the world’s savannas ({\textgreater}7000 species) and high levels of endemism. Species richness of birds, fishes, reptiles, amphibians, and insects is equally high, whereas mammal diversity is relatively low. Deforestation rates have been higher in the Cerrado than in the Amazon rainforest, and conservation efforts have been modest: only 2.2\% of its area is under legal protection. Numerous animal and plant species are threatened with extinction, and an estimated 20\% of threatened and endemic species do not occur in protected areas. Soil erosion, the degradation of the diverse Cerrado vegetation formations, and the spread of exotic grasses are widespread and major threats. The use of fire for clearing land and to encourage new growth for pasture has also caused damage, even though the Cerrado is a fire-adapted ecosystem. Ecosystem experiments and modeling show that change in land cover is altering the hydrology and affecting carbon stocks and fluxes. Cerrado agriculture is lucrative, and agricultural expansion is expected to continue, requiring improvements in and extension of the transportation infrastructure, which will affect not only the Cerrado but also the Amazon forest. Large-scale landscape modification and threats to numerous species have led to renewed interest from various sectors in promoting the conservation of the Cerrado, particularly through strengthening and enlarging the system of protected areas and improving farming practices and thus the livelihoods of local communities.},

According to Nightwish songwriter Tuomas Holopainen, the album is a concept album that tells the story of an old composer who is reminiscing of his youth on his deathbed. The album was produced alongside the movie of the same name, directed by Stobe Harju, who previously directed Nightwish's "The Islander" music video, and the album and the film share the same themes and general story. It is their second and last album with vocalist Anette Olzon, as well as the last with drummer Jukka Nevalainen.
The first single off the album, "Storytime", was released on November 9, 2011 and quickly topped the Finnish single charts. According to Iltasanomat, Imaginaerum sold more than 50,000 copies in Finland during the first day after release. It has been described as Nightwish's best album by Sonic Seducer and was chosen as the album of the month by Dutch metal magazine Aardschok Magazine.},

	abstract = {Pavel Tsatsouline,  (Belarusian: Павел Цацулін, romanized: Paveł Caculin; born 23 August 1969 in Minsk, USSR) is the Chairman of StrongFirst, Inc., a fitness instructor who has introduced SPETSNAZ training techniques from the former Soviet Union to US Navy SEALs, Marines and Army Special Forces, and shortly thereafter to the American public.Tsatsouline is particularly notable for popularizing the kettlebell in the modern era in the West, most notably through his books and through a series of instructional videos, delivered with his trademark comedic intent, comically exploiting Russian stereotypes with a thick accent, a dungeon-esque setting, and frequent use of the word "comrade". Vic Sussman among others praised Tsatsouline's videos because their power as training tools in part stemmed from the emphasis on kettlebells as fun. Pavel's strength training exercises were solely focused on practical strength and mobility. For him bigger did not always mean stronger.He holds a degree in Sports Science from the Physical Culture Institute in Minsk.   He is involved with the evolving field of martial arts fitness and is a proponent of the kettlebell as an exercise and strengthening tool. In 1998, Tsatsouline became a kettlebell instructor in the United States.Tsatsouline claims to have been a PT drill instructor for Spetsnaz, the elite Soviet special forces unit, during the late 1980s (when Tsatsouline was in his teenage years).In 2001, Tsatsouline was voted a "Hot Trainer" by Rolling Stone, pictured with a kettlebell in hand. He was considered the father of the kettle bell and popularized the usage of kettle bell exercise to increase strength. He has published articles in Milo magazine and Performance Press, as well as being the author of several books on stretching and strength training (see Bibliography).
In 2012, Pavel left the RKC and formed a new company, StrongFirst.},

Since our founding in 1980, faculty research has played an integral role in promoting negotiation as a field of interdisciplinary academic study and real-world application. Our research team draws faculty from many traditional disciplines, including law, business, psychology, public policy and planning, and international relations. Each research project is led by PON faculty who hail from one of three consortium universities—Harvard, MIT, and Tufts. These individuals represent some of the world’s leading scholars in negotiation theory and practice. Working},

Some agencies regulate particular types of institutions for risky behavior or conflicts of interest, some agencies promulgate rules for certain financial transactions no matter what kind of institution engages in them, and other agencies enforce existing rules for some institutions, but not for others.

The series will carry work by IMF staff and will seek to provide insight into the intersection of technology and the global economy. The Rise of Digital Money analyses how technology companies are stepping up competition to large banks and credit card companies. Digital forms of money are increasingly in the wallets of consumers as well as in the minds of policymakers. Cash and bank deposits are battling with so-called e-money, electronically stored monetary value denominated in, and pegged to, a currency like the euro or the dollar. This paper identifies the benefits and risks and highlights regulatory issues that are likely to emerge with a broader adoption of stablecoins. The paper also highlights the risks associated with e-money: potential creation of new monopolies; threats to weaker currencies; concerns about consumer protection and financial stability; and the risk of fostering illegal activities, among others.},

The report focuses on five key aspects of a CCP's financial risk management framework: governance, stress testing for both credit and liquidity exposures, coverage, margin, and a CCP's contribution of its financial resources to losses. The guidance should be understood in the context of the principles-based approach reflected in the PFMI, which recognises CCPs' differing organisations, functions and designs, and the different ways to achieve a particular result. The guidance is not intended to impose additional standards for CCPs beyond those set out in the PFMI. However, CCPs may need to make changes to their rules, procedures, governance arrangements and risk management frameworks in order for practices to be consistent with the guidance. Relevant authorities may also determine that it is necessary to make changes to their regulatory frameworks. CCPs should promptly identify any areas where changes are necessary, and address them as soon as practicable, so that implementation of the necessary changes is completed no later than the end of 2017.},

	abstract = {In the wake of the recent financial crisis, over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives have been blamed for increasing systemic risk. Although OTC derivatives were not a central cause of the crisis, the complexity and limited transparency of the market reinforced the potential for excessive risk-taking, as regulators did not have a clear view into how OTC derivatives were being used. We discuss how the New York Fed and other regulators could improve weaknesses in the OTC derivatives market through stronger oversight and better regulatory incentives for infrastructure improvements to reduce counterparty credit risk and bolster market liquidity, efficiency, and transparency. Used responsibly with these reforms, over-the-counter derivatives can provide important risk management and liquidity benefits to the financial system.},

	abstract = {The G20’s push towards central clearing changed the shape of the world’s ﬁnancial system: all standardized derivative contracts must now be cleared through central counterparties (CCPs). Despite considerable debate, the impact of central clearing nonetheless remains ambiguous and hard to measure as clearing regulations have been implemented alongside many other changes. In the present paper, we isolate the impact of CCPs by ﬁrst representing all trade and risk relations of a ﬁnancial system in a graph model. We then formalize clearing as an operator on those graphs and obtain sharp a priori bounds of its effect on total risk levels. Using numerical simulation, we then show how clearing alters the credit risk exposures of each bank depending on the netting structure of its trades. Further, we demonstrate how CCPs only reduce the total levels of risk in the system if their credit quality is substantially higher than that of the banks. We show, paradoxically, how the CCPs expose the system to substantial concentration risk and thereby undermine their initial purpose.},

In light of the problems that emerged during the crisis, a number of MMF reforms have been proposed, which we analyze in this paper. We assume that the main goal of MMF reform is safeguarding global financial stability. In light of this goal, reforms should reduce the ex ante incentives for MMFs to take excessive risk and increase the ex post resilience of MMFs to system-wide runs. Our analysis suggests that requiring MMFs to have subordinated capital buffers could generate significant financial stability benefits. Subordinated capital provides MMFs with loss absorption capacity, lowering the probability that an MMF suffers losses large enough to trigger a run, and reduces incentives to take excessive risks. Other reform alternatives based on market forces, such as converting MMFs to a floating NAV, may be less effective in protecting financial stability.

	abstract = {Many of the world’s developed economies have introduced, or are planning to introduce, bank bail-in regimes that involve the participation of bank creditors in bearing the costs of restoring a failing bank to health. There is a long list of actual or hypothetical advantages attached to the bail-in process. Therefore, there is a need for a closer examination of the bail-in process, if it is to become a successful substitute to the unpopular bailout approach. The bail-in tool involves replacing the implicit public guarantee, on which fractional reserve banking has operated, with a system of private penalties. The bail-in approach may, indeed, be much superior to bailouts in the case of idiosyncratic failure. In other cases, the bail-in process may entail important risks. The article provides a legal and economic analysis of some of the key potential risks bail-ins may entail both in the domestic and cross-border contexts. It explains why bail-in regimes will not eradicate the need for injection of public funds where there is a threat of systemic collapse, because a number of banks have simultaneously entered into difﬁculties, or in the event of the failure of a large complex cross-border bank, unless the failure was clearly idiosyncratic.},

Informally, they are also known as Spyders or Spiders.  SPDR is a trademark of Standard and Poor's Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of S\&P Global. SPDR means Standard and Poor's Depository Receipt.
The name is an acronym for the first member of the family, the Standard \& Poor's Depositary Receipts, now the SPDR S\&P 500, which is designed to track the S\&P 500 stock market index. For a long time, this fund was the largest ETF in the world. SSGA also manage the SPDR Gold Shares, which for a while was the second-largest ETF in the world. As of August 2012, they were the first and second largest exchange-traded products in the world.The funds are formulated as unit investment trusts. In 2007, SSGA rebranded its other United States ETFs as SPDRs, including the StreetTRACKS family and its other flagship ETF shares, the DOW DIAMONDS, that tracks the Dow Jones Industrial Average. This move united all U.S. ETFs managed by SSGA, a total of 23 at that time, under a single brand.  
At the end of 2006, the total portfolio that became known as SPDRs had \$102 billion of assets under management.As of Dec 2019, SPDR is the third largest ETF provider, behind iShares and Vanguard, with assets of \$714 bn.},

Below is a summary of some of the important algorithms from the history of manifold learning and nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR). Many of these non-linear dimensionality reduction methods are related to the linear methods listed below. Non-linear methods can be broadly classified into two groups: those that provide a mapping (either from the high-dimensional space to the low-dimensional embedding or vice versa), and those that just give a visualisation.  In the context of machine learning, mapping methods may be viewed as a preliminary feature extraction step, after which pattern recognition algorithms are applied.

	abstract = {Judicial control of public power ensures a guarantee of the rule of law. This book addresses the scope and limits of judicial control at the national level, i.e. the control of public authorities, and at the supranational level, i.e. the control of States. It explores the risk of judicial review leading to judicial activism that can threaten the principle of the separation of powers or the legitimate exercise of state powers. It analyzes how national and supranational legal systems have embodied certain mechanisms, such as the principles of reasonableness, proportionality, deference and margin of appreciation, as well as the horizontal effects of human rights that help to determine how far a judge can go. Taking a theoretical and comparative view, the book first examines the conceptual bases of the various control systems and then studies the models, structural elements, and functions of the control instruments in selected countries and regions. It uses country and regional reports as the basis for the comparison of the convergences and divergences of the implementation of control in certain countries of Europe, Latin America, and Africa. The book’s theoretical reflections and comparative investigations provide answers to important questions, such as whether or not there are nascent universal principles concerning the control of public power, how strong the impact of particular legal traditions is, and to what extent international law concepts have had harmonizing and strengthening effects on internal public-power control.},

	abstract = {In jurisdictions following the English common law system, equity is the body of law which was developed in the English Court of Chancery and which is now administered concurrently with the common law.For much of its history, the English common law was principally developed and administered in the central royal courts: the Court of King's Bench, the Court of Common Pleas, and the Exchequer. Equity was the name given to the law which was administered in the Court of Chancery. The Judicature Reforms in the 1870s effected a procedural fusion of the two bodies of law, ending their institutional separation. The reforms did not effect any substantive fusion, however. Judicial or academic reasoning which assumes the contrary has been described as a "fusion fallacy".Jurisdictions which have inherited the common law system differ in their current treatment of equity. Over the course of the twentieth century some common law systems began to place less emphasis on the historical or institutional origin of substantive legal rules. In England, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, equity remains a distinct body of law. Modern equity includes, among other things:
The law relating to express, resulting, and constructive trusts;
Fiduciary law;
Equitable estoppel (including promissory and proprietary estoppel);
Relief against penalties and relief against forfeiture;
The doctrines of contribution, subrogation and marshalling; and
Equitable set-off.The latter part of the twentieth century saw increased debate over the utility of treating equity as a separate body of law. These debates were labelled the "fusion wars". A particular flashpoint in this debate centred on the concept of unjust enrichment and whether areas of law traditionally regarded as equitable could be rationalised as part of a single body of law known as the law of unjust enrichment.},

The public justification of participation as a strategy with respect to human dignity, with mechanisms that ponder the discourse, but also the right to the truth, finally with the consideration of the just to accept the legitimacy of a decision imposes procedures that establish a solid impact between both spheres.},

	abstract = {The Rules Enabling Act (ch. 651, Pub.L. 73–415, 48 Stat. 1064, enacted June 19, 1934, 28 U.S.C. § 2072) is an Act of Congress that gave the judicial branch the power to promulgate the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Amendments to the Act allowed for the creation of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and other procedural court rules.  The creation and revision of rules pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act is usually carried out by the Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure (known as the "Standing Committee") and its advisory committees, which are part of the Judicial Conference of the United States, the policymaking body of the United States federal courts.
The enactment of the Rules Enabling Act on June 19, 1934, was a revolutionary moment in the history of civil procedure in the United States.  The law repealed the archaic "conformity principle" which had governed actions at law (and only actions at law) in U.S. federal courts for over 140 years; namely, the rule that federal courts should conform their procedure in such actions to that of the courts in the state in which they were located.  The conformity principle had caused major problems for federal courts that did not actually sit in the United States, such as the United States Court for China.
While the courts exercised rulemaking powers granted to them under the Act without Congressional intervention for nearly forty years, Congress refused to allow the Federal Rules of Evidence to go into effect after their approval by the Supreme Court in 1973.  The Rules of Evidence were eventually passed, with substantial changes, as legislation by Congress.  Because of Congress's intervention in 1973 and subsequent years, the rulemaking powers granted to the judiciary by the Act have been reduced, causing the Act to command less importance in recent years. However, the Act makes it very difficult for litigants to challenge the constitutional validity of the Federal Rules under the Erie Doctrine.},

	volume = {125},
	issn = {0017-811X},
	shorttitle = {Foreword},
	abstract = {Why is the "neutrality" of Supreme Court decisionmaking a matter of persistent political disagreement? What should be done to mitigate such conflict? Once the predominant focus of constitutional law scholarship, efforts to answer these questions are now widely viewed as evincing misunderstandings of what can be coherently demanded of theory and realistically expected of judges. This Foreword attributes the Court's ''neutrality crisis" to a very different form of misunderstanding. The study of motivated reasoning (in particular, cultural cognition) shows that individuals are predisposed to fit their perceptions of policy-relevant facts to their group commitments. In the course of public deliberations, these facts become suffused with antagonistic meanings that transform utilitarian policymaking into occasions for symbolic status competition. These same dynamics, this Foreword argues, make constitutional decisionmaking the focus of status competition among groups whose members are unconsciously motivated to fit perceptions of the Court's decisions to their values. Theories of constitutional neutrality do not address the distinctive cognitive groundings of this form of illiberal conflict; indeed, they make it worse by promoting idioms of justification, in Court opinions and public discourse generally, that reinforce the predisposition of diverse groups to attribute culturally partisan aims to those who disagree with them. Just as the divisive effects of motivated reasoning on policy deliberations can be offset by science communication techniques that avoid selectively threatening any group's cultural worldview, so public confidence in the Supreme Court's neutrality can be restored by the Court's communication of meanings that uniformly affirm the values of culturally diverse citizens.},

Kennedy, whose pivotal role on the Rehnquist Court is only expected to grow in importance now that he is the lone 'swing Justice' on the Roberts Court. The Ties Goes to Freedom is the first book-length analysis of Kennedy, and it challenges the conventional wisdom that his jurisprudence is inconsistent and incoherent. Using the hot-button issues of privacy rights, race, and free speech, this book demonstrates how Kennedy forcefully articulates a libertarian constitutional vision. The Tie Goes to Freedom fills two significant voids—one examining the jurisprudence of the man at the ideological center of the Supreme Court, the other demonstrating the compatibility of an expansive judicial role with libertarian political theory. At the end of Kennedy’s tenure as the most important swing justice in recent Supreme Court history, Helen Knowles provides an updated edition of her highly regarded book on Justice Kennedy and his constitutional vision.},

	abstract = {Clinical psychology is an integration of science, theory, and clinical knowledge for the purpose of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychologically-based distress or dysfunction and to promote subjective well-being and personal development. Central to its practice are psychological assessment, clinical formulation, and psychotherapy, although clinical psychologists also engage in research, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration. In many countries, clinical psychology is a regulated mental health profession.
The field is generally considered to have begun in 1896 with the opening of the first psychological clinic at the University of Pennsylvania by Lightner Witmer. In the first half of the 20th century, clinical psychology was focused on psychological assessment, with little attention given to treatment. This changed after the 1940s when World War II resulted in the need for a large increase in the number of trained clinicians. Since that time, three main educational models have developed in the USA—the Ph.D. Clinical Science model (heavily focused on research), the Ph.D. science-practitioner model (integrating scientific research and practice), and the Psy.D. practitioner-scholar model (focusing on clinical theory and practice). In the UK and the Republic of Ireland, the Clinical Psychology Doctorate falls between the latter two of these models, whilst in much of mainland Europe, the training is at the masters level and predominantly psychotherapeutic. Clinical psychologists are expert in providing psychotherapy, and generally train within four primary theoretical orientations—psychodynamic, humanistic, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and systems or family therapy.},

Whether computed on test data or through cross-validation, this error rate is suited for classification purposes. We claim that it is, however, a partial indicator only of the quality of the knowledge provided by trees and that there is a need for additional indicators. For example, the error rate is not representative of the quality of the description provided. In this paper we focus on this descriptive aspect. We consider the deviance as a goodness-of-fit statistic that attempts to measure how well the tree is at reproducing the conditional distribution of the response variable for each possible profile (rather than the individual response value for each case) and we discuss various statistical tests that can be derived from them. Special attention is devoted to computational aspects.},

	url = {https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Rules_of_Civil_Procedure&oldid=951430440},
	abstract = {The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (officially abbreviated Fed. R. Civ. P.; colloquially FRCP) govern civil procedure in United States district courts. The FRCP are promulgated by the United States Supreme Court pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act, and then the United States Congress has seven months to veto the rules promulgated or they become part of the FRCP.  The Court's modifications to the rules are usually based upon recommendations from the Judicial Conference of the United States, the federal judiciary's internal policy-making body. Although federal courts are required to apply the substantive law of the states as rules of decision in cases where state law is in question, the federal courts almost always use the FRCP as their rules of civil procedure. (States may determine their own rules, which apply in state courts, although 35 of the 50 states have adopted rules that are based on the FRCP.)
The Rules, established in 1938, replaced the earlier procedures under the Federal Equity Rules and the Conformity Act (28 USC 724 (1934)) merging the procedure for cases, in law and  equity. The Conformity Act required that procedures in suits at law conform to state practice usually the Field Code and common law pleading systems. Significant revisions have been made to the FRCP in 1948, 1963, 1966, 1970, 1980, 1983, 1987, 1993, 2000, and 2006. (The FRCP contains a notes section that details the changes of each revision since 1938, explaining the rationale behind the language.) The revisions that took effect in December 2006 made practical changes to discovery rules to make it easier for courts and litigating parties to manage electronic records.
The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were amended in 1966 to unify the civil and admiralty procedure, and added the Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims (now Supplemental Rules for Admiralty or Maritime Claims and Asset Forfeiture Actions).
The FRCP were completely rewritten, effective December 1, 2007, under the leadership of a committee headed by law professor and editor of Black's Law Dictionary, Bryan A. Garner, for the avowed purpose of making them easier to understand. The style amendments were not intended to make substantive changes in the rules.Effective December 1, 2009 substantial amendments were made to rules 6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 23, 27, 32, 38, 48, 50, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 59, 62, 65, 68, 71.1, 72 and 81. While rules 48 and 62.1 were added. Rule 1 (f) was abrogated. The majority of the amendments affect various timing requirements and change how some deadlines are calculated. The most significant changes are to Rule 6.
Before the FRCP were established, common-law pleading was more formal, traditional, and particular in its phrases and requirements. For example, a plaintiff bringing a trespass suit would have to mention certain key words in his complaint or risk having it dismissed with prejudice. In contrast, the FRCP is based upon a legal construction called notice pleading, which is less formal, is created and modified by legal experts, and is far less technical in requirements. In notice pleading, the same plaintiff bringing suit would not face dismissal for lack of the exact legal term, as long as the claim itself was legally actionable. The policy behind this change is to simply give "notice" of grievances and to leave the details for later in the case. This acts in the interest of equity by concentrating on the actual law rather than the exact construction of pleas.
Thirty-five states have adopted procedural codes based on the Federal Rules, but sometimes there are slight variations.
In addition to notice pleading, a minority of states (e.g., California) use an intermediate system known as code pleading, which is a system older than notice pleading and which is based upon legislative statute. It tends to straddle the gulf between obsolete common-law pleading and modern notice pleading. Code pleading places additional burdens on a party to plead the "ultimate facts" of its case, laying out the party's entire case and the facts or allegations underlying it. Notice pleading, by contrast, simply requires a "short and plain statement" showing only that the pleader is entitled to relief. (FRCP 8(a)(2)).  One important exception to this rule is that, when a party alleges fraud, it must plead the facts of the alleged fraud with particularity. (FRCP 9(b)).
(The Field Code, which was adopted between 1848 and 1850, was an intermediate step between common law and modern rules, created by New York attorney David Dudley Field. Field's code, among other reforms, merged law and equity proceedings.)},

	abstract = {We define causal estimands for experiments on single time series, extending the potential outcome framework to dealing with temporal data. Our approach allows the estimation of a broad class of these estimands and exact randomization-based p-values for testing causal effects, without imposing stringent assumptions. We further derive a general central limit theorem that can be used to conduct conservative tests and build confidence intervals for causal effects. Finally, we provide three methods for generalizing our approach to multiple units that are receiving the same class of treatment, over time. We test our methodology on simulated “potential autoregressions,” which have a causal interpretation. Our methodology is partially inspired by data from a large number of experiments carried out by a financial company who compared the impact of two different ways of trading equity futures contracts. We use our methodology to make causal statements about their trading methods. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

	abstract = {Mark Elliott is Vice Provost of International Affairs at Harvard University and the Mark Schwartz Professor of Chinese and Inner Asian History in the Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations and in the Department of History in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.   As Vice Provost, Elliott oversees and works to advance international academic initiatives, extending the global reach of Harvard’s research and teaching activities. In this capacity, Elliott serves as the University’s representative in negotiating agreements with foreign governments, receiving senior-level international delegations, and representing Harvard to peer institutions and alumni worldwide. In addition, he shares responsibility for supporting the community of international students, scholars, and faculty in Cambridge and Boston, as well as for guiding Harvard’s overall global strategy and sustaining its ongoing development as a global university.  Elliott is an authority on the last four centuries of Chinese history, in particular the Qing period (1636-1911). His research encompasses the history of relations between China and its nomadic frontier, with special attention to questions of ethnicity and empire. His first book, The Manchu Way: The Eight Banners and Ethnic Identity in Late Imperial China, is a pioneering study in the “New Qing History,” an approach emphasizing the imprint of Inner Asian traditions upon China’s last imperial state. He is also the author of Emperor Qianlong: Son of Heaven, Man of the World, and has published more than twenty-five scholarly articles. He serves on numerous editorial boards, and was for three years the director of the Fairbank Center of Chinese Studies.  A graduate of Yale (BA 1981 summa cum laude, MA 1984), Elliott earned his PhD in History at the University of California, Berkeley. He taught at the University of California, Santa Barbara and at the University of Michigan before coming to Harvard in 2003.  He can be found on Twitter at @Mark\_C\_Elliott.

	abstract = {SPDR funds (pronounced "spider") are a family of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) traded in the United States, Europe, and Asia-Pacific and managed by State Street Global Advisors (SSGA).  Informally, they are also known as Spyders or Spiders.  SPDR is a trademark of Standard and Poor's Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of S\&P Global. SPDR means Standard and Poor's Depository Receipt.
The name is an acronym for the first member of the family, the Standard \& Poor's Depositary Receipts, now the SPDR S\&P 500, which is designed to track the S\&P 500 stock market index. For a long time, this fund was the largest ETF in the world. SSGA also manage the SPDR Gold Shares, which for a while was the second-largest ETF in the world. As of August 2012, they were the first and second largest exchange-traded products in the world.The funds are formulated as unit investment trusts. In 2007, SSGA rebranded its other United States ETFs as SPDRs, including the StreetTRACKS family and its other flagship ETF shares, the DOW DIAMONDS, that tracks the Dow Jones Industrial Average. This move united all U.S. ETFs managed by SSGA, a total of 23 at that time, under a single brand.  
At the end of 2006, the total portfolio that became known as SPDRs had \$102 billion of assets under management.As of Dec 2019, SPDR is the third largest ETF provider, behind iShares and Vanguard, with assets of \$714 bn.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05964},
	abstract = {For a long time, many social scientists have conducted content analysis by using their substantive knowledge and manually coding documents. In recent years, however, fully automated content analysis based on probabilistic topic models has become increasingly popular because of their scalability. Unfortunately, applied researchers find that these models often fail to yield topics of their substantive interest by inadvertently creating multiple topics with similar content and combining different themes into a single topic. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that providing topic models with a small number of keywords can substantially improve their performance. The proposed keyword assisted topic model (keyATM) offers an important advantage that the specification of keywords requires researchers to label topics prior to fitting a model to the data. This contrasts with a widespread practice of post-hoc topic interpretation and adjustments that compromises the objectivity of empirical findings. In our applications, we find that the keyATM provides more interpretable results, has better document classification performance, and is less sensitive to the number of topics than the standard topic models. Finally, we show that the keyATM can also incorporate covariates and model time trends. An open-source software package is available for implementing the proposed methodology.},

When Wolfensohn took over at the World Bank in 1995, he viewed himself as a spiritual successor to a former World Bank chief, Robert McNamara.  He was born in Sydney, Australia, and is a graduate of the University of Sydney and Harvard Business School; he was also an Olympic fencer. He worked for various companies in Britain and the United States before forming his own investment firm. Wolfensohn became an American citizen in 1980, requiring him to renounce his Australian citizenship although he eventually regained it in 2010. He served two terms as President of the World Bank on the nomination of U.S. President Bill Clinton, and has since held various positions with charitable organisations.},

	abstract = {Les crises économiques et le chômage en Occident sont toujours tenus pour responsables des augmentations périodiques du taux de suicide. Cette croyance est renfoncée par des études et des reportages médiatiques depuis le milieu du xixe siècle. Cette affirmation est soutenue par des données qui proviennent des statistiques officielles des suicides accomplis, malgré d’importantes preuves de leur faillibilité. À partir de méthodes et de classifications douteuses, les chercheurs insistent toujours sur le fait que les comportements et les motivations individuels peuvent être révélés par l’étude de forces sociales – et tout particulièrement économiques – plus larges. Cet article examine la persistance de ces croyances et leur impact sur la politique publique depuis Durkheim. À partir de l’ouvrage souvent cité mais rarement lu de Jack Douglas (Social Meanings of Suicide), je propose une approche alternative sur l’étiologie du suicide qui repose sur le sens social et qui remet en question les postulats essentialistes, selon lesquels les aspirations, les succès et les échecs humains portent toujours le même sens et la même définition. Ces postulats prétendent à l’uniformité culturelle des motivations et de la compréhension du suicide parmi les différents genres, ethnicités et classes.},

Idiopathic renal hypouricemia is a genetic disorder characterized by hypouricemia with abnormally high renal tubular uric acid excretion. The mutation in SCL22A12 gene which encodes renal uric acid transporter, URAT1, is the known major cause of this disorder. We here described a 25-yr-old man showing idiopathic renal hypouricemia with G774A mutation in SCL22A12 who presented exercise-induced acute renal failure. There have been a few reports of mutational analysis in Korean idiopathic renal hypouricemia without acute renal failure. This is the first report of genetically diagnosed idiopathic renal hypouricemia with exercise-induced acute renal failure in Korea.},

	abstract = {Acute kidney injury (AKI), previously called acute renal failure (ARF), is an abrupt loss of kidney function that develops within 7 days.Its causes are numerous. Generally it occurs because of damage to the kidney tissue caused by decreased kidney blood flow (kidney ischemia) from any cause (e.g., low blood pressure), exposure to substances harmful to the kidney, an inflammatory process in the kidney, or an obstruction of the urinary tract that impedes the flow of urine. AKI is diagnosed on the basis of characteristic laboratory findings, such as elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, or inability of the kidneys to produce sufficient amounts of urine.
AKI may lead to a number of complications, including metabolic acidosis, high potassium levels, uremia, changes in body fluid balance, and effects on other organ systems, including death. People who have experienced AKI may have an increased risk of chronic kidney disease in the future. Management includes treatment of the underlying cause and supportive care, such as renal replacement therapy.},

	abstract = {Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder in which excess copper builds up in the body. Symptoms are typically related to the brain and liver. Liver-related symptoms include vomiting, weakness, fluid build up in the abdomen, swelling of the legs, yellowish skin and itchiness. Brain-related symptoms include tremors, muscle stiffness, trouble speaking, personality changes, anxiety and seeing or hearing things that others do not.Wilson's disease is caused by a mutation in the Wilson disease protein (ATP7B) gene. This protein transports excess copper into bile, where it is excreted in waste products. The condition is autosomal recessive; for a person to be affected, they must inherit a mutated copy of the gene from both parents. Diagnosis may be difficult and often involves a combination of blood tests, urine tests and a liver biopsy. Genetic testing may be used to screen family members of those affected.Wilson's disease is typically treated with dietary changes and medication. Dietary changes involve eating a low-copper diet and not using copper cookware. Medications used include chelating agents such as trientine and d-penicillamine and zinc supplements. Complications of Wilson's disease can include liver failure, liver cancer and kidney problems. A liver transplant may be helpful in those in whom other treatments are not effective or if liver failure occurs.Wilson's disease occurs in about 1 in 30,000 people. Symptoms usually begin between the ages of 5 and 35 years. It was first described in 1854 by German pathologist Friedrich Theodor von Frerichs and is named after British neurologist Samuel Wilson.},

	abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease in which the insulating covers of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord are damaged. This damage disrupts the ability of parts of the nervous system to transmit signals, resulting in a range of signs and symptoms, including physical, mental, and sometimes psychiatric problems. Specific symptoms can include double vision, blindness in one eye, muscle weakness and trouble with sensation or coordination. MS takes several forms, with new symptoms either occurring in isolated attacks (relapsing forms) or building up over time (progressive forms). Between attacks, symptoms may disappear completely; however, permanent neurological problems often remain, especially with the advancement of the disease.While the cause is unclear, the underlying mechanism is thought to be either destruction by the immune system or failure of the myelin-producing cells. Proposed causes for this include genetics and environmental factors such as being triggered by a viral infection. MS is usually diagnosed based on the presenting signs and symptoms and the results of supporting medical tests.There is no known cure for multiple sclerosis. Treatments attempt to improve function after an attack and prevent new attacks. Medications used to treat MS, while modestly effective, can have side effects and be poorly tolerated. Physical therapy can help with people's ability to function. Many people pursue alternative treatments, despite a lack of evidence of benefit. The long-term outcome is difficult to predict, with good outcomes more often seen in women, those who develop the disease early in life, those with a relapsing course and those who initially experienced few attacks. Life expectancy is on average 5 to 10 years lower than that of the unaffected population.Multiple sclerosis is the most common immune-mediated disorder affecting the central nervous system. In 2015, about 2.3 million people were affected globally, with rates varying widely in different regions and among different populations. In that year, about 18,900 people died from MS, up from 12,000 in 1990. The disease usually begins between the ages of 20 and 50 and is twice as common in women as in men. MS was first described in 1868 by French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot. The name multiple sclerosis refers to the numerous glial scars (or sclerae – essentially plaques or lesions) that develop on the white matter of the brain and spinal cord. A number of new treatments and diagnostic methods are under development.},

	abstract = {Hyperthyroidism is the condition that occurs due to excessive production of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland. Thyrotoxicosis is the condition that occurs due to excessive thyroid hormone of any cause and therefore includes hyperthyroidism. Some, however, use the terms interchangeably. Signs and symptoms vary between people and may include irritability, muscle weakness, sleeping problems, a fast heartbeat, heat intolerance, diarrhea, enlargement of the thyroid, hand tremor, and weight loss. Symptoms are typically less severe in the elderly and during pregnancy. An uncommon complication is thyroid storm in which an event such as an infection results in worsening symptoms such as confusion and a high temperature and often results in death. The opposite is hypothyroidism, when the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone.Graves' disease is the cause of about 50\% to 80\% of the cases of hyperthyroidism in the United States. Other causes include multinodular goiter, toxic adenoma, inflammation of the thyroid, eating too much iodine, and too much synthetic thyroid hormone. A less common cause is a pituitary adenoma. The diagnosis may be suspected based on signs and symptoms and then confirmed with blood tests. Typically blood tests show a low thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and raised T3 or T4. Radioiodine uptake by the thyroid, thyroid scan, and TSI antibodies may help determine the cause.Treatment depends partly on the cause and severity of disease. There are three main treatment options: radioiodine therapy, medications, and thyroid surgery. Radioiodine therapy involves taking iodine-131 by mouth which is then concentrated in and destroys the thyroid over weeks to months. The resulting hypothyroidism is treated with synthetic thyroid hormone. Medications such as beta blockers may control the symptoms, and anti-thyroid medications such as methimazole may temporarily help people while other treatments are having effect. Surgery to remove the thyroid is another option. This may be used in those with very large thyroids or when cancer is a concern. In the United States hyperthyroidism affects about 1.2\% of the population. It occurs between two and ten times more often in women. Onset is commonly between 20 and 50 years of age. Overall the disease is more common in those over the age of 60 years.},

	abstract = {Fanconi syndrome or Fanconi's syndrome (English: , ) is a syndrome of inadequate reabsorption in the proximal renal tubules of the kidney. The syndrome can be caused by various underlying congenital or acquired diseases, by toxicity (for example, from toxic heavy metals), or by adverse drug reactions. It results in various small molecules of metabolism being passed into the urine instead of being reabsorbed from the tubular fluid (for example, glucose, amino acids, uric acid, phosphate, and bicarbonate). Fanconi syndrome affects the proximal tubules, namely, the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT), which is the first part of the tubule to process fluid after it is filtered through the glomerulus, and the proximal straight tubule (pars recta), which leads to the descending limb of loop of Henle.
Different forms of Fanconi syndrome can affect different functions of the proximal tubule, and result in different complications. The loss of bicarbonate results in type 2 or proximal renal tubular acidosis. The loss of phosphate results in the bone diseases rickets and osteomalacia (even with adequate vitamin D and calcium levels), because phosphate is necessary for bone development in children and even for ongoing bone metabolism in adults.},

NACE uses four hierarchical levels:
Level 1: 21 sections identified by alphabetical letters A to U;
Level 2: 88 divisions identified by two-digit numerical codes (01 to 99);
Level 3: 272 groups identified by three-digit numerical codes (01.1 to 99.0);
Level 4: 615 classes identified by four-digit numerical codes (01.11 to 99.00).The first four digits of the code, which is the first four levels of the classification system, are the same in all European countries. National implementations may introduce additional levels. The fifth digit might vary from country to country and further digits are sometimes placed by suppliers of databases.},

The forecast error variance of GDP growth for each of the GDPNow model, Blue Chip, and the Federal Reserve staff’s Green Book is decomposed as the sum of the forecast error covariances for the contributions to growth of the subcomponents of GDP. The decompositions show that “net exports” and “change in private inventories” are particularly difficult subcomponents to nowcast.},

To quantify the impact of the stress tests, we construct a measure of the capital implied by the supervisory stress tests relative to the level of capital implied by the banks’ own models, which we call the capital gap. We then study the impact of the capital gap on the loan growth of BHCs with more than \$10 billion in assets. The higher capital implied by supervisory stress tests relative to that suggested by the banks’ own models does not appear to unduly restrict loan growth. Consistent with previous results in the bank capital literature, we find evidence that among the CCAR banks, more capital is associated with higher loan growth.},

We show that there is a real prospect that index funds will continue to grow, and that voting in most significant public companies will come to be dominated by the future “Giant Three.” We begin by analyzing the drivers of the rise of the Big Three, including the structural factors that are leading to the heavy concentration of the index funds sector. We then provide empirical evidence about the past growth and current status of the Big Three, and their likely growth into the Giant Three. Among other things, we document that the Big Three have almost quadrupled their collective ownership stake in S\&P 500 companies over the past two decades; that they have captured the overwhelming majority of the inflows into the asset management industry over the past decade, that each of them now manages 5\% or more of the shares in a vast number of public companies; and that they collectively cast an average of about 25\% of the votes at S\&P 500 companies.},

Its objective is to 'provide strategic assistance to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and other private sector organizations for the protection of selected vital ecosystems in World Bank member countries that have ratified the convention on biological diversity.' Launched in December 2000 by the World Bank, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and CI, the program has since enlisted additional support from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur foundation and the Government of Japan in 2001 and 2002, respectively. The French Development Agency joined the program in March 2007. CEPF focuses its interventions on the world's 'hotspots', geographic areas characterized by exceptional levels of endemism and serious levels of habitat loss. During its first phase, CEPF established programs in 15 regions within 14 hotspots, with spending plans worth more than \$100 million. By June 2007, CEPF had committed a total of \$89.8 million, \$28.9 million to four hotspots in Latin America, \$28.8 million to five in Africa, \$7 million to one in the Caucasus, and \$25.1 million to four hotspots in East Asia. Nine of the 15 grant portfolios are currently closed to new grants.},

	abstract = {Anne Marie Treisman (née Taylor; 27 February 1935 – 9 February 2018) was an English psychologist who specialised in cognitive psychology.
Treisman researched visual attention, object perception, and memory. One of her most influential ideas is the feature integration theory of attention, first published with Garry Gelade in 1980. Treisman taught at the University of Oxford, University of British Columbia, University of California, Berkeley and Princeton University. Notable postdoctoral fellows she supervised included Nancy Kanwisher and Nilli Lavie.
In 2013 Treisman received the National Medal of Science from President Barack Obama for her pioneering work in the study of attention. During her long career, Treisman experimentally and theoretically defined the issue of how information is selected and integrated to form meaningful objects that guide human thought and action.},

	abstract = {Daniel Kahneman (; Hebrew: דניאל כהנמן‎; born March 5, 1934) is an Israeli-American psychologist and economist notable for his work on the psychology of judgment and decision-making, as well as behavioral economics, for which he was awarded the 2002 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (shared with Vernon L. Smith). His empirical findings challenge the assumption of human rationality prevailing in modern economic theory.
With Amos Tversky and others, Kahneman established a cognitive basis for common human errors that arise from heuristics and biases (Kahneman \& Tversky, 1973; Kahneman, Slovic \& Tversky, 1982; Tversky \& Kahneman, 1974), and developed prospect theory (Kahneman \& Tversky, 1979).
In 2011, he was named by Foreign Policy magazine in its list of top global thinkers. In the same year, his book Thinking, Fast and Slow, which summarizes much of his research, was published and became a best seller.He is professor emeritus of psychology and public affairs at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School. Kahneman is a founding partner of TGG Group, a business and philanthropy consulting company. He was married to cognitive psychologist and Royal Society Fellow Anne Treisman, who died in 2018.In 2015, The Economist listed him as the seventh most influential economist in the world.},

The position originated in England. Some Commonwealth countries have either abolished the position, or re-named it so as to remove monarchical connotations, for example, ’Senior Counsel’ or ’Senior Advocate’. 
Queen's Counsel is an office, conferred by the Crown, that is recognised by courts. Members have the privilege of sitting within the bar of court. The term is recognised as an honorific. As members wear silk gowns of a particular design (see court dress), appointment as Queen's Counsel is known informally as receiving, obtaining, or taking silk and QCs are often colloquially called silks. Appointments are made from within the legal profession on the basis of merit rather than a particular level of experience. However, successful applicants tend to be barristers, or (in Scotland) advocates with 15 years of experience or more.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06321},
	abstract = {Bayesian Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a promising approach for understanding uncertainty and structure in matrix data. However, a large volume of applied work optimizes traditional non-Bayesian NMF objectives that fail to provide a principled understanding of the non-identifiability inherent in NMF-- an issue ideally addressed by a Bayesian approach. Despite their suitability, current Bayesian NMF approaches have failed to gain popularity in an applied setting; they sacrifice flexibility in modeling for tractable computation, tend to get stuck in local modes, and require many thousands of samples for meaningful uncertainty estimates. We address these issues through a particle-based variational approach to Bayesian NMF that only requires the joint likelihood to be differentiable for tractability, uses a novel initialization technique to identify multiple modes in the posterior, and allows domain experts to inspect a `small' set of factorizations that faithfully represent the posterior. We introduce and employ a class of likelihood and prior distributions for NMF that formulate a Bayesian model using popular non-Bayesian NMF objectives. On several real datasets, we obtain better particle approximations to the Bayesian NMF posterior in less time than baselines and demonstrate the significant role that multimodality plays in NMF-related tasks.},

The nature of ﬁnancial regulatory costs and beneﬁts poses a great challenge for formalized analysis. Healthand-safety or environmental regulation focuses on simple actions, like releasing a pollutant. The costs and beneﬁts of ﬁnancial regulation focus on the behavioral, market, general equilibrium, and political reactions. I offer some suggestions on the structure of a cost-beneﬁt process that recognizes the nature of ﬁnancial regulation costs and beneﬁts, lying between pure conceptual cost-beneﬁt analysis and the rigid legal structure currently envisioned.},

	doi = {10.3390/jrfm13040074},
	abstract = {In 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published an assessment of the long-term economic impact (LEI) of stronger capital and liquidity requirements. This paper considers this assessment in light of estimates from later studies of the macroeconomic benefits and costs of higher capital requirements. Consistent with the Basel Committee’s original assessment, this paper finds that the net macroeconomic benefits of capital requirements are positive over a wide range of capital levels. Under certain assumptions, the literature finds that the net benefits of higher capital requirements may have been understated in the original committee assessment. Put differently, the range of estimates for the theoretically optimal level of capital requirements—where marginal benefits equal marginal costs—is likely either similar to, or higher than was originally estimated by the Basel Committee. The above conclusion is however subject to a number of important considerations. First, estimates of optimal capital are sensitive to a number of assumptions and design choices. For example, the literature differs in judgments made about the permanence of crisis effects as well as assumptions about the efficacy of post crisis reforms, such as liquidity regulations and bank resolution regimes, in reducing the probability and costs of future banking crisis. In some cases, these judgements can offset the upward tendency in the range of optimal capital. Second, differences in (net) benefit estimates can reflect different conditioning assumptions such as starting levels of capital or default thresholds (the capital ratio at which firms are assumed to fail) when estimating the impact of capital in reducing crisis probabilities. Finally, the estimates are based on capital ratios that are measured in different units. For example, some studies provide optimal capital estimates in risk-weighted ratios, others in leverage ratios. And, across the risk-weighted ratio estimates, the definition of capital and risk-weighted assets (RWAs) can also differ (e.g., tangible common equity (TCE) or Tier 1 or common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital; Basel II RWAs vs. Basel III measures of RWAs). A full standardisation of the different estimates across studies to allow for all of these considerations is not possible on the basis of the information available and lies beyond the scope of this paper. This paper also suggests a set of issues which warrant further monitoring and research. This includes the link between capital and the cost and probability of crises, accounting for the effects of liquidity regulations, resolution regimes and counter-cyclical capital buffers, and the impact of regulation on loan quantities.},

	abstract = {Using a novel within-dealer, within-security identiﬁcation strategy, we examine intended and unintended eﬀects of the Volcker rule on covered ﬁrms’ corporate bond trading using dealeridentiﬁed regulatory data. We use the underwriting exemption to isolate the Volcker rule’s eﬀects separate from other post-crisis changes in bank regulation and broader trends in market liquidity. We ﬁnd no evidence of the rule’s intended reduction in the riskiness of covered ﬁrms’ trading in corporate bonds. We ﬁnd signiﬁcant adverse liquidity eﬀects on covered ﬁrms’ corporate bond trading with 20-45 basis points higher costs for customers even for roundtrip trades of shorter duration. These eﬀects do not appear to be transitional. The Volcker rule appears to have increased the cost of the liquidity provided by covered ﬁrms and has not decreased the liquidity risk exposure of covered ﬁrms. Finally, the Volcker rule has decreased the market share of covered ﬁrms. Customers appear to be trading more with non-bank dealers, who are exempt from the Volcker rule but also lack access to emergency liquidity support at the Fed’s discount window.},

The ﬁndings do not support the Moral Hazard Hypothesis, in which these banks expand credit supply−particularly to relatively risky borrowers that pay high spreads−increasing their risk.

In December 2018, the Delaware Chancery Court answered this question in the negative in the landmark decision Sciabacucchi v. Salzberg. The court invalidated “federal forum provisions” (“FFPs”) that allow companies to select federal district courts as the exclusive venue for claims brought under the Securities Act of 1933 (“1933 Act”). The decision held that the internal affairs doctrine, which is the bedrock of U.S. corporate law, does not permit charter and bylaw provisions that restrict rights under federal law. In March 2020, the Delaware Supreme Court overturned the Chancery’s decision in Salzberg v. Sciabacucchi, holding, among others, that in addition to “internal” affairs, charters and bylaws can regulate “intra-corporate” affairs, including choosing the forum for Securities Act claims.},

	abstract = {Theory predicts that “common ownership” (ownership of rivals by a common shareholder) can be anticompetitive because it reduces the weight ﬁrms place on their own proﬁts and shifts weight toward rival ﬁrms held by common shareholders. In this paper we use accounting data from the banking industry to examine empirically whether shifts in the proﬁt weights are associated with shifts in proﬁts. We present the distribution of a wide range of estimates that vary the speciﬁcation, sample restrictions, and assumptions used to calculate the proﬁt weights. The distribution of estimates is roughly centered around zero, but we ﬁnd statistically signiﬁcant estimates in either direction in some cases. Economically, most estimates are fairly small. Our interpretation of these ﬁndings is that there is little evidence for economically important eﬀects of common ownership on proﬁts in the banking industry.},

Rather than focusing on single industries, as most related studies do, we assess the common ownership hypothesis in the aggregate, using a panel of about 3,000 U.S. firms in about 200 industries over a 21-year period. We hypothesize that if anticompetitive effects due to common ownership were present within individual industries, then the same anticompetitive outcomes should be observed when the data is expanded to cover all industries and over an extended period of time. We explore the statistical relationship between our chosen measure of common ownership and profitability across multiple model specifications, such as (1) two alternative econometric models, (2) different sets of control variables, (3) different time periods, and (4) four variations of MHHIΔ. We do not find conclusive evidence that common ownership is associated with industry-level profit margins.},

Recently, some intriguing recent economic research by Azar, Schmalz and Tecu (working paper 2015) and Azar, Raina and Schmalz (working paper 2016) purports to show that concentration among shareholdings has led to higher prices in the airline and banking industries, two concentrated industries. Based on this research, Einer Elhauge (2016) has argued that current ownership patterns by diversified institutional investors violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act. Following on Elhauge, Posner, Weyl and Scott Morton (working paper 2016) propose a “solution” in which diversified investors would be limited to acquiring one firm in any oligopoly.},

We examine the potential effects of this shift on financial stability through four different channels: (1) effects on investment funds’ liquidity transformation and redemption risks; (2) passive strategies that amplify market volatility; (3) increases in asset-management industry concentration; and (4) the effects on valuations, volatility, and comovement of assets that are included in indexes. Overall, the shift from active to passive investment strategies appears to be increasing some types of risk while diminishing others: The shift has probably reduced liquidity transformation risks, although some passive strategies amplify market volatility, and passive-fund growth is increasing asset-management industry concentration. We find mixed evidence that passive investing is contributing to the comovement of assets. Finally, we use our framework to assess how financial stability risks are likely to evolve if the shift to passive investing continues, noting that some of the repercussions of passive investing ultimately may slow its growth.},

In the years following the housing and mortgage market turmoil that began around 2007, the GSEs experienced financial difficulty. By 2008, the GSEs’ financial condition had weakened, generating concerns over their ability to meet their combined obligations on \$1.2 trillion in bonds and \$3.7 trillion in MBSs that they had guaranteed at the time.

              in his essay as “the domestic law of each nation that governs how that nation interacts with the rest of the world.” In this contribution to the symposium, I wish to explore the relation between foreign relations law and national constitutions, arguing that a “foreign relations lens” helps elucidate an underappreciated core purpose of these foundational texts. Next, I want to show how the shifting boundaries of constitutions serve to allocate lawmaking authority, emphasizing the substitution between international and domestic norms. Finally, I offer a comparative constitutional perspective on foreign relations law, laying out an agenda for future work in the area.},

	abstract = {The presidential-parliamentary distinction is foundational to comparative politics and at the center of a large theoretical and empirical literature. However, an examination of constitutional texts suggests a fair degree of heterogeneity within these categories with respect to important institutional attributes. These observations indicate that the classic presidential-parliamentary distinction, and the semi-presidential category, may not be systemic. This article investigates whether the defining attributes that separate presidential and parliamentary constitutions predict other attributes that are stereotypically associated with these institutional models. The results suggest the need for considerable skepticism of the ‘systemic’ nature of the classification. Indeed, the results imply that in order to predict the powers of a country's executive and legislature, it is more useful to know where and when the constitution was written than whether the country has a presidential or parliamentary system.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to assess the effect of deposit insurance on the risk-taking behaviour of banks. As shown in the theoretical literature, deposit insurance may induce moral hazard and incentivize banks to take on more risk. In this paper we provide an experimental setup in which we exploit an increase in the coverage limit of deposit insurance in the U.S. in order to identify the difference in risk taking by banks that were affected and banks that were not. This difference comes from the fact that state chartered savings banks in Massachusetts had unlimited deposit insurance coverage at the time when it was increased for all other banks in the US. Given that all banks in the sample are subject to the same regulatory and supervisory requirements, and that they are similar in other characteristics, we can isolate the effect of such increase in deposit insurance. We find, contrary to the literature, that this increase in deposit insurance did not increase bank risk-taking.},

	abstract = {An argument that contagion is the most significant risk facing the financial system and that Dodd¬Frank has reduced the government's ability to respond effectively.
                The Dodd–Frank Act of 2010 was intended to reform financial policies in order to prevent another massive crisis such as the financial meltdown of 2008. Dodd–Frank is largely premised on the diagnosis that connectedness was the major problem in that crisis—that is, that financial institutions were overexposed to one another, resulting in a possible chain reaction of failures. In this book, Hal Scott argues that it is not connectedness but contagion that is the most significant element of systemic risk facing the financial system. Contagion is an indiscriminate run by short-term creditors of financial institutions that can render otherwise solvent institutions insolvent. It poses a serious risk because, as Scott explains, our financial system still depends on approximately \$7.4 to \$8.2 trillion of runnable and uninsured short-term liabilities, 60 percent of which are held by nonbanks.Scott argues that efforts by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the Treasury to stop the contagion that exploded after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers lessened the economic damage. And yet Congress, spurred by the public's aversion to bailouts, has dramatically weakened the power of the government to respond to contagion, including limitations on the Fed's powers as a lender of last resort. Offering uniquely detailed forensic analyses of the Lehman Brothers and AIG failures, and suggesting alternative regulatory approaches, Scott makes the case that we need to restore and strengthen our weapons for fighting contagion.},

This provides suﬃcient conditions for the nonparametric identiﬁcation of dynamic causal eﬀects as well as clarify the causal content of several common assumptions and methods in macroeconomics. Our key identifying assumption is shown to be non-anticipating treatments which enables nonparametric inference on dynamic causal eﬀects. Next, we provide a formal deﬁnition of a “shock” and this leads to a shocked potential outcome time series. This is a nonparametric statement of the Frisch-Slutzky paradigm. The common additional assumptions that the causal eﬀects are additive and that the treatments are shocks place substantial restrictions on the underlying dynamic causal estimands. We use this structure to causally interpret several common estimation strategies. We provide suﬃcient conditions under which local projections is causally interpretable and show that the standard assumptions for local projections with an instrument are not suﬃcient to identify dynamic causal eﬀects. We ﬁnally show that the structural vector moving average form is causally equivalent to a restricted potential outcome time series under the usual invertibility assumption.},

	abstract = {Regression discontinuity designs are extensively used for causal inference in observational studies. However, they are usually confined to settings with simple treatment rules, determined by a single running variable, with a single cutoff. In this paper, we propose a new framework and methods for complex discontinuity designs that encompasses multiple treatment rules. These rules may be determined by multiple running variables, each with many cutoffs, that possibly lead to the same treatment. Moreover, the running variables may be discrete and the treatments do not need to be binary. In this framework, the observed covariates play a central role for identification, estimation, and generalization of causal effects. Identification is non-parametric and relies on a local strong ignorability assumption; that is, on local unconfoundedness and local positivity assumptions. Estimation proceeds as in any observational study under strong ignorability, yet in a neighborhood of the cutoffs of the running variables. We discuss estimation approaches based on matching and weighting, including additional regression adjustments in the spirit of doubly robust estimators. We present assumptions for generalization; that is, for identification and estimation of average treatment effects for target populations beyond the study sample that reside in a neighborhood of the cutoffs. We also propose two approaches to select the neighborhood for the analyses and assess the plausibility of the assumptions. We motivate and illustrate this framework with an example of the impact of grade retention on educational and juvenile crime outcomes.},

The estimator is based on ﬁnding, for each unit that needs to be matched, sets of observations such that a convex combination of them has the same covariate values as the unit needing matching or with minimized distance between them. We implement the proposed estimator with data from the National Supported Work Demonstration, ﬁnding outstanding performance in terms of covariate balance. Monte Carlo evidence shows that our estimator performs well in designs previously used in the literature.},

	abstract = {This registration form is for restaurants, licensed food establishments, and non-essential retailers that want to begin operations on open spaces, whether on public space or private property during Phase One. 
 Restaurants may open outdoor seating with physical distancing and safeguards measures. Non-essential retailers may provide curbside pickup and delivery.

Note: During Phase One existing enclosed sidewalk cafes must operate as unenclosed cafes pursuant to DC Municipal Regulations Title 24, Chapter 3, Section 316.10:

"316.10	When required to be unenclosed, the enclosed sidewalk café shall be operated with all of its windows opened and so that the enclosed sidewalk café shall not be enclosed from the thirty-six inch (36 in.) base to eight feet (8 ft.) above the sidewalk; Provided, that structural members that are wider or bigger than ten inches (10 in.) shall not be permitted."

This registration form is also for community organizations that plan to occupy portions of roadways and alleys consistent with Mayor’s Order 2020-067.  After completing this form, organizations must complete an "Other Special Events" public space permit application.  For these programs, use of public space cannot begin until after DDOT has approved plans and issued a public space permit.

Upon completion of this registration form, restaurants and licensed food establishments that want to expand their use of public space or that currently do not have a sidewalk cafe permit must also apply for a public space permit to provide outdoor tableside service in public space. Non-essential retailers, may provide curbside pickup and delivery by submitting a permit.  Information on how to submit a public space permit application is included in the relevant pages of this registration form.

All entities must follow the Mayor’s Order and the industry specific guidance posted at coronavirus.dc.gov/phaseone

	abstract = {We analyze the effect of rising Chinese import competition between 1990 and 2007 on US local labor markets, exploiting cross-market variation in import exposure stemming from initial differences in industry specialization and instrumenting for US imports using changes in Chinese imports by other high-income countries. Rising imports cause higher unemployment, lower labor force participation, and reduced wages in local labor markets that house import-competing manufacturing industries. In our main specification, import competition explains one-quarter of the contemporaneous aggregate decline in US manufacturing employment. Transfer benefits payments for unemployment, disability, retirement, and healthcare also rise sharply in more trade-exposed labor markets. (JEL E24, F14, F16, J23, J31, L60, O47, R12, R23)},

He has written several books on the Tudors.
Starkey is a well-known radio and television personality, first appearing on television in 1977. While a regular contributor to the BBC Radio 4 debate programme The Moral Maze, his acerbic tongue earned him the sobriquet of "rudest man in Britain"; his frequent appearances on Question Time have been received with criticism and applause. Starkey has presented several history documentaries. In 2002, he signed a £2 million contract with Channel 4 for 25 hours of programming, and in 2011 was a contributor on the Channel 4 series Jamie's Dream School.},

It was published in March 2009 by Oxford University Press. In addition to Lewis, other contributors to the book include J. Gordon Melton, William Sims Bainbridge, Douglas E. Cowan, David G. Bromley, Anson Shupe, James T. Richardson, and Susan J. Palmer. Scientology gives an overview and introduction to the organization, and presents an analysis of the movement from the perspective of sociology. The book compares the organization to other religious movements, and goes over its history of controversy. It delves into the practices of the organization and activities of its missions.
Scientology was given an unfavorable review in the International Journal of Cultic Studies, which considered the book unduly biased in Scientology's favour, a view echoed in a review in satirical magazine Private Eye. It received a positive review in Alternative Spirituality and Religion Review, describing it as "the most sophisticated academic item published on Scientology" to date, a book to be read by journalists and academics alike, and "the most important collection of scholarly articles on Scientology published so far – in any language".},

The paper describes the policies with great care, it offers many examples of the successful implementation of those policies in different countries, it provides an empirical analysis showing the pick-ups in economic growth that have followed the implementation of those polices, and it gives the results of simulations of policies from a so-called endogenous growth model. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Federal debt is on an unsustainable path. Low interest rates mean that we do not need to reduce budget deficits immediately and that we should do more public investment. However, we will need to make deficit-reducing changes eventually, and we should set those changes in motion now and use the extra time provided by low interest rates to phase in the changes gradually. The largest long-term changes will come through tax increases rather than spending cuts: the appetite for significant reductions in the big benefit programs is very limited among voters and their representatives on both sides of the aisle. Moreover, we should reduce deficits in ways that do not “share the sacrifice” as much as “steer the sacrifice” toward people who have been doing better. I worry that, in the next economic downturn, we will not undertake the fiscal expansion we should. We will have fiscal space in an economic sense, but I fear that too many people will pick that moment to be especially concerned about deficits (as occurred in 2011 and 2012). We have a uniquely inefficient healthcare system in this country. We probably should and probably will make more policy changes that amount to price-setting, rather than relying on market forces to hold down prices.},

	abstract = {A short-run negative relationship between monetary aggregates and interest rates — the ‘liquidity effect’ — is central to discussions of monetary policy. This paper searches for this empirical relationship. We investigate whether the characterization of the liquidity effect is sensitive to: (i) changes in sample period, (ii) conditioning the correlations on past information, (iii) assuming money growth is exogenous, and (iv) treating monetary changes as anticipated or unanticipated. The correlations change substantially in each case. We conclude that the traditional analysis and modern models, which rely completely on demand-side behavior, cannot explain the observed correlations. A successful characterization of the liquidity effect requires identification of both private and policy behavior.},

	url = {https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPKF5__pUmE},
	abstract = {For FAQ about the type of freezer, how to set this up, gear used etc. see pinned first comment. Over the past years I have been experimenting with a lot of different ways to start your day, what works and what doesn’t work. A good morning routine makes you feel in control and this sets the tone for the rest of your day. 

For the first hour of my day I will make it a clear point to NOT get on my phone. Instead I focus every day on meditation, Wim Hof Method inspired deep breathing, journaling, ice baths and a few other routines. This 3 minute video shows the first 30 minutes of my day. 

Full details with benefits about each practice can be found on my blog: http://extramilest.com/blog/my-mornin...

********** SAFETY WARNING - Please don’t do anything stupid. Always make sure to unplug the electricity before going in. Do not do the Wim Hof breathing exercise in water, while driving or in other critical situations. If there is a short loss of consciousness, this can be deadly! Ease into cold exposure and don’t stay in too long. One way to start out is by taking cold showers and transitioning from there to short ice baths. ********** 

This is my morning routine for most days of the week, some days I start my routine after my early morning run. Setting aside 30 minutes in the mornings will positively influence the rest of your day. Consistency is key in developing a morning routine that works for you and actually sticking to it. Meditation, deep breathing, gratitude journaling and cold therapy bring me tremendous health benefits, physically, mentally and spiritually. 

If you are developing your own morning routine, I suggest trying different things for several days and asking yourself “how am I currently feeling”? Write down your experiences and use tools like the Fitbit to track body markers such as resting heart rate, sleep stages, etc over time to notice differences. Don’t put too much pressure on yourself, start for example with a 5 minutes daily meditation for a week. Be kind to yourself and have fun!

What morning routine have you used or are you looking to start with? Please let me know in the comments below!

	abstract = {Let’s decipher the numbers. Your KETOSCAN Mini reading is in PPM (parts per million). This is the acetone (ketone) concentration at 100 resolutions (0.0 – 99). After taking a test on your KETOSCAN Mini, this PPM reading will be displayed on your device. When you start using your KETOSCAN Mini, the PPM numbers may not mean a lot to you – especially if you have been used to testing your blood for ketones. We recommend downloading the Ketoscan app, which will display and track your PPM reading as well as your ketosis level. These levels are numbered from 1 to 10 and are summarised below: Ketosis levels Level 0 (0.0-1.0 PPM) – you are not in ketosis Level 1 (1.1-1.9 PPM) – you are nearly in ketosis Level 2 (2.0 – 2.9 PPM) – you are in the very early stages of ketosis Level 3 (3.0-3.9 PPM) – you are in the early stages of ketosis Level 4 (4.0 – 4.9 PPM) – you are entering a reliable level of ketosis Level 5 (5.0 – 5.9 PPM) – you at a reliable level of ketosis Level 6 (6.0 – 6.9 PPM) – you are at a stable level of ketosis […]},

	abstract = {Objective
Endogenous acetone production is a by‐product of the fat metabolism process. Because of its small size, acetone appears in exhaled breath. Historically, endogenous acetone has been measured in exhaled breath to monitor ketosis in healthy and diabetic subjects. Recently, breath acetone concentration (BrAce) has been shown to correlate with the rate of fat loss in healthy individuals. In this review, the measurement of breath acetone in healthy subjects is evaluated for its utility in predicting fat loss and its sensitivity to changes in physiologic parameters.

Results
BrAce can range from 1 ppm in healthy non‐dieting subjects to 1,250 ppm in diabetic ketoacidosis. A strong correlation exists between increased BrAce and the rate of fat loss. Multiple metabolic and respiratory factors affect the measurement of BrAce. BrAce is most affected by changes in the following factors (in descending order): dietary macronutrient composition, caloric restriction, exercise, pulmonary factors, and other assorted factors that increase fat metabolism or inhibit acetone metabolism. Pulmonary factors affecting acetone exchange in the lung should be controlled to optimize the breath sample for measurement.

Conclusions
When biologic factors are controlled, BrAce measurement provides a non‐invasive tool for monitoring the rate of fat loss in healthy subjects.},

Despite the benefits of this diet, health care professionals still question its safety due to the elevated serum ketones it induces and the limited dietary fiber. To compound the controversy, patient compliance with the program is poor due to the restrictive nature of the diet and symptoms related to energy deficit and gastrointestinal adversity during the introductory and energy substrate transition phase of the diet. The studies presented here demonstrate safety and efficacy of the diet including the scientific support and rationale for the administration of exogenous ketone bodies and ketone sources as a complement to the restrictive dietary protocol or as an alternative to the diet. This review also highlights the synergy provided by exogenous ketone, β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), accompanied by the short chain fatty acid, butyrate (BA) in the context of cellular and physiological outcomes. More work is needed to unveil the molecular mechanisms by which this program provides health benefits.},

E bom sempre visitar o site da embaixada dos EUA no pais ao qual voce estara pedidndo seu visto, e entrar em contato com eles para mais detalhes.
As vezes o processo e simples, mais as vezes e exigido provas de que voce esta legal naquele pais, ou outras provas.
Se tiverem mais duvidas e so escrever nos comentarios ou me mandar um email.

	abstract = {Workaholics Anonymous (WA) is a twelve-step program for people identifying themselves as "powerless over compulsive work, worry, or activity" including, but not limited to, workaholics–including overworkers and those who suffer from unmanageable procrastination or work aversion. Anybody with a desire to stop working compulsively is welcome at a WA meeting. Unmanageability can include compulsive work in housework, hobbies, fitness, or volunteering as well as in paid work. Anyone with a problematic relationship with work is welcomed. Workaholics Anonymous is considered an effective program for those who need its help. 
In 1983, one of the first formal efforts to create a fellowship around work addiction recovery began in New York when a corporate financial planner and a school teacher met. They formed Workaholics Anonymous to stop working compulsively themselves and to help others who suffered from the disease of workaholism. In their first meetings, spouses joined them and in retrospect were the first Work-Anon group, seeking recovery for family and friends of workaholics. 
Workaholics Anonymous is an international fellowship of over fifty in-person, phone, and online meetings with over an estimated thousand active members. WA's World Service Office has a Menlo Park central address. WA has developed its own literature, most notably the Workaholics Anonymous Book of Recovery, but also uses the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) books Alcoholics Anonymous and Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions.},

	abstract = {Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous (SLAA) is a twelve-step program for people recovering from sex addiction and love addiction. SLAA was founded in Boston, Massachusetts in 1976, by a member of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). Though he had been a member of AA for many years, he repeatedly acted out and was serially unfaithful to his wife. He founded SLAA as an attempt to stop his compulsive sexual and "romantic" behavior. SLAA is also sometimes known as the Augustine Fellowship, because early members saw many of their shared symptoms described by St. Augustine of Hippo in his work Confessions. COSLAA is another twelve-step fellowship created to support the family members and friends of sex and love addicts.
SLAA encourages members to identify their own "bottom-line behaviors." The organization identifies these behaviors as "any sexual or emotional act, no matter what its initial impulse may be, which leads to loss of control over rate, frequency, or duration of its occurrence or recurrence, resulting in spiritual, mental, physical, emotional, and moral destruction of oneself and others." Maintaining "sobriety" in the SLAA program requires abstaining from one's bottom-line behaviors. However, these behaviors are never set in stone and may change as SLAA members continue in the program. Examples of bottom-line behaviors might include sexual or romantic activity outside the scope of monogamous relationships, anonymous or casual sex, compulsive avoidance of intimacy or emotional attachment, one-night stands, compulsive masturbation, obsessive fantasy, compulsive attraction to unavailable or abusive partners, and a wide variety of addictive sexual, romantic, or avoidant behaviors.
Many of those practicing the SLAA recovery program develop the ability to engage in a healthy committed relationship. SLAA encourages recovery from sexual anorexia, emotional anorexia and social anorexia, three related areas of self-deprivation that lead to isolation and often accompany patterns of addictive behavior.SLAA publishes the book Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous. It is approved by the organization for use in their fellowship. In an article regarding the applicability of 12-Step fellowships to black women, Feminist theorist Christine Saulnier criticized the SLAA book, contending that it ignored the social and political circumstances under which sexual behaviors arise and are labeled deviant.},

	abstract = {Sexaholics Anonymous (SA) is one of several twelve-step programs for compulsive sexual behavior based on the original twelve steps of Alcoholics Anonymous. SA takes its place among various twelve-step groups that seek recovery from sexual addiction: Sex Addicts Anonymous, Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous, Sexual Compulsives Anonymous and Sexual Recovery Anonymous. Collectively these groups are referred to as "S" groups since all their acronyms begin with that letter: SA, SAA, SLAA, SCA, SRA.
SA helps recovering "sexaholics." According to the group, a sexaholic is someone for whom "lust has become an addiction."  SA distinguishes itself from other S groups by defining sexual sobriety as no sex with self or with partners other than with one's spouse "in the marriage between a man and a woman", and progressive victory over lust.
"In defining sobriety, we do not speak for those outside Sexaholics Anonymous. We can only speak for ourselves. Thus, for the married sexaholic, sexual sobriety means having no form of sex with self or with persons other than the spouse. For the unmarried sexaholic, sexual sobriety means freedom from sex of any kind. And for all of us, single and married alike, sexual sobriety also includes progressive victory over lust".The group uses the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous and the book "Sexaholics Anonymous" (often referred to as "The White Book") as a guide. The White Book explains that "the sexaholic has taken himself or herself out of the whole context of what is right or wrong. He or she has lost control, no longer has the power of choice, and is not free to stop."},

	abstract = {We model how ETFs compete and set fees. We show that ETF secondary market liquidity plays a key role in determining fees and leads to liquidity clienteles. More liquid ETFs charge higher fees in equilibrium and attract shorter horizon investors that are more sensitive to liquidity than to fees. The higher turnover of these investors sustains the ETF's high liquidity, allowing the ETF to maintain a higher fee and extract a rent. These liquidity rents create a first-mover advantage among ETFs and impact investor welfare. Our empirical tests confirm the presence of liquidity clienteles and show that ETF fee differentials provide a novel measure of the value of liquidity. Our findings resolve the apparent paradox that ETFs with higher fees than their competitors can not only survive, but flourish in equilibrium due to the value of liquidity.},

	abstract = {The effectiveness of negative interest rates as a monetary policy tool depends importantly on the response of the banking sector. This paper offers unique new insights for U.S. banks by using supervisory data to examine bank-level expectations regarding the impact of negative rates on profitability through net interest margins. The main results show that the largest U.S. banks differ significantly in how they respond to negative interest rates. The most significant channel of adverse exposure comes from the pass-through of the negative policy rate to interest rates on short-term liquid assets held on the balance sheet. At the same time, on the liability side, banks that rely more heavily on short-term wholesale funding, including financing through the repo market, may benefit through a reduction in funding costs. In the aggregate, these effects likely wash out as liquidity provision is sufficiently well diversified across the banking sector as a whole.},

              in his essay as “the domestic law of each nation that governs how that nation interacts with the rest of the world.” In this contribution to the symposium, I wish to explore the relation between foreign relations law and national constitutions, arguing that a “foreign relations lens” helps elucidate an underappreciated core purpose of these foundational texts. Next, I want to show how the shifting boundaries of constitutions serve to allocate lawmaking authority, emphasizing the substitution between international and domestic norms. Finally, I offer a comparative constitutional perspective on foreign relations law, laying out an agenda for future work in the area.},

	abstract = {The presidential-parliamentary distinction is foundational to comparative politics and at the center of a large theoretical and empirical literature. However, an examination of constitutional texts suggests a fair degree of heterogeneity within these categories with respect to important institutional attributes. These observations indicate that the classic presidential-parliamentary distinction, and the semi-presidential category, may not be systemic. This article investigates whether the defining attributes that separate presidential and parliamentary constitutions predict other attributes that are stereotypically associated with these institutional models. The results suggest the need for considerable skepticism of the ‘systemic’ nature of the classification. Indeed, the results imply that in order to predict the powers of a country's executive and legislature, it is more useful to know where and when the constitution was written than whether the country has a presidential or parliamentary system.},

The Commission released a draft report last week accompanied by a speech by Secretary Pompeo where he attacked the 1619 Project, questioned the so-called proliferation of rights and the role of international courts, and pointed to America’s unique role in championing “the dignity of every human being made in the image of God.”

We study the effects of surprises in policy rate forecasts from the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) on real yields and breakeven inflation rates derived from government bonds for forward rates across the yield curve. We find that surprises in the SEP policy rate forecasts significantly affect real yields in the expected direction across the yield curve. By contrast, breakeven inflation rates are little affected across the yield curve. In particular, five-year breakeven inflation rates five years ahead, a common measure of monetary policy credibility, are not significantly affected by surprises in SEP policy rate forecasts. This suggests that policy rate forecasts by the Fed at the ZLB managed to affect real yields without adversely affecting monetary policy credibility.},

A particular focus is on the impact of the Sharpe ratio. We give necessary and suﬃcient conditions that volatility scaling improves the Sharpe ratio of an investment. We approximate the Sharpe improvement using the sum of two terms: one determined by the convexity of the precision and the other the covariance of the precision and conditional mean. We show that empirically this approximation is very accurate and we document the relative importance of the two terms.},

An example of a cap would be an agreement to receive a payment for each month the LIBOR rate exceeds 2.5\%.
Similarly an interest rate floor is a derivative contract in which the buyer receives payments at the end of each period in which the interest rate is below the agreed strike price.
Caps and floors can be used to hedge against interest rate fluctuations. For example, a borrower who is paying the LIBOR rate on a loan can protect himself against a rise in rates by buying a cap at 2.5\%.  If the interest rate exceeds 2.5\% in a given period the payment received from the derivative can be used to help make the interest payment for that period, thus the interest payments are effectively "capped" at 2.5\% from the borrowers' point of view.},

	abstract = {While observers agree that courts function poorly in developing countries, a lack of data has limited our understanding of the causes of malfunction. We combine data from administrative records on severance cases filed in the Mexico City Labor Court with interventions that provide information to parties in randomly selected cases on predicted case outcomes and conciliation services. We first use the data to document a set of stylized facts about the functioning of the court. The interventions nearly double the overall settlement rate, but only when the plaintiff herself is present to receive the information directly. Administrative records from six months after the treatment indicate that the treatment effects remain unchanged over that period, even though an additional one in three cases in the control group settle in that period. The post-treatment results indicate that lawyers do not convey the information provided in the intervention to their clients. A simple analytic framework rationalizes the experimental results. Analysis of settlements induced by the interventions suggests that the provision of information is welfare-improving for the plaintiffs. The experimental results replicate over two phases conducted in different sub-courts, showing robustness.},

	abstract = {Olympic Boulevard (formerly 10th Street) is a major arterial road in Los Angeles, California.  It stretches from Ocean Avenue on the western end of Santa Monica to East Los Angeles—farther than Wilshire Boulevard and most other streets.
Its path runs parallel to and north of Pico Boulevard from Santa Monica to Downtown Los Angeles, and parallel to and south of Santa Monica Boulevard on its western end and Wilshire Boulevard past Beverly Hills.
Like other major Los Angeles streets, Olympic is at least four lanes in width. Unlike other east-west arterial roads such as Wilshire Boulevard, Santa Monica Boulevard, and Sunset Boulevard, it does not cross   major attractions and sites and therefore contains far less traffic. While Wilshire crosses through the heart of Los Angeles, Olympic runs through the southern end of principal areas such as West Los Angeles, Westwood, Century City, Beverly Hills, Hancock Park, Koreatown, Westlake and Downtown Los Angeles. Little Ethiopia is east of Fairfax Avenue and Olympic. Proceeding east on Olympic, it breaks off in Downtown LA's Fashion District but continues on from there, passing the southern areas of Boyle Heights, East Los Angeles and Montebello with an eastern terminus in Montebello as a small neighborhood street.
Olympic Boulevard is primarily a commercial, urban street. There is a grass divider with trees in the Santa Monica portion. Around Carthay, Olympic passes through residential neighborhoods. A number of schools are located on Olympic as well. Crossroads School is located at Olympic and 20th in Santa Monica, New Roads Middle School is located at the Franklin/Berkeley St. area in Santa Monica. and Wildwood School is located in between Bundy and Barrington. Los Angeles High School is located slightly to the east of Olympic and Highland Avenue.
Olympic expands to six lanes starting east of Santa Monica and generally maintains a speed limit of 45 miles per hour (72 km/h). Even so, due to Los Angeles traffic, Olympic often becomes congested.
It was originally named 10th Street, but was renamed Olympic Boulevard for the 1932 Summer Olympics, as that was the occasion of the tenth modern event.  Tenth Street School, at Olympic and Grattan, was founded in 1888 and has kept the original name. Parts of the old 10th Street exist as smaller streets near Hancock Park, in Westlake, and in the Central City East area southeast of Downtown.},

	abstract = {The Sensors Directorate at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) along with Defense Research Associates, Inc. (DRA) conducted a flight demonstration of technology that could potentially satisfy the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) requirement for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to sense and avoid local air traffic sufficient to provide an "...equivalent level of safety, comparable to see-and-avoid requirements for manned aircraft". This FAA requirement must be satisfied for autonomous UAV operation within the national airspace. The real-time on-board system passively detects approaching aircraft, both cooperative and non-cooperative, using imaging sensors operating in the visible/near infrared band and a passive moving target indicator algorithm. Detection range requirements for RQ-4 and MQ-9 UAVs were determined based on analysis of flight geometries, avoidance maneuver timelines, system latencies and human pilot performance. Flight data and UAV operating parameters were provided by the system program offices, prime
contractors, and flight-test personnel. Flight demonstrations were conducted using a surrogate UAV (Aero Commander) and an intruder aircraft (Beech Bonanza). The system demonstrated target detection ranges out to 3 nautical miles in nose-to-nose scenarios and marginal visual meteorological conditions. (VMC) This paper will describe the sense and avoid requirements definition process and the system concept (sensors, algorithms, processor, and flight rest results) that has demonstrated the potential to satisfy the FAA sense and avoid
requirements.},

Vehicles. UAVs began to be used with the war of Vietnam, they had a
great interest when Israel used them in Bekaa Valley Operations of 1982.
UAVs have been used by different countries with different aims with the
help of emerging technology and investments. In this article, in the
context of areas of UAV usage in national security, benefits and
disadvantages of UAVs are put forward. Particularly, it has been
evaluated on the basis of cost-effectiveness by focusing the use of UAV
in the border security. UAVs have been studied by taking cost analysis,
procurement and operational costs into consideration. Analysis of
effectiveness has been done with illegal passages of people and drugs
from flight times of UAVs. Although the procurement cost of the
medium-level UAVs is low, its operational costs are high. For this
reason, the idea of less costly alternative systems have been revealed
for the border security. As the costs are reduced to acceptable level
involving national security and border security in future with
high-technology products in their structure, it will continue to be used
in an increasing proportion.},

coronavirus disease, but it remains unclear the extent to which these unprecedented measures

coronavirus disease cases as well as on real-time containment measures implemented by
countries. Results suggest that these measures have been very effective in flattening the
“pandemic curve”, but there is significant heterogeneity across countries. Effectiveness is
enhanced when measures are implemented quickly, where de facto mobility is curtailed, in
countries with lower temperatures and population density, as well as in countries with a
larger share of the elderly in total population and stronger health systems. We also find that
easing of containment measures has resulted in an increase in the number of cases, but the
effect has been lower (in absolute value) than that from a tightening of measures.},

	abstract = {We show that domestic production networks shape worker flows between firms. Data on the universe of firm-to-firm transactions for the Dominican Republic, matched with employer-employee records, reveals that about 20 percent of workers who change firms move to a buyer or supplier of their original firm. This is a considerably larger share than would be implied by a random allocation of movers to firms. We find considerable gains associated with this form of hiring: higher worker wages, lower job separation rates, faster firm productivity growth, and faster coworker wage growth. Hiring workers from a supplier is followed by a rising share of purchases from that supplier. These findings indicate that human capital is easily transferable along the supply chain and that human capital accumulated while working at a firm is complementary with the intermediate products/services produced by that firm.},

Using data on IT adoption covering almost three million establishments in the US, we find that technology adoption can partly shield the economy from the impact of the pandemic. In areas where firms adopted more IT the unemployment rate rose less in response to social distancing. Our estimates imply that if the pandemic had hit the world 5 years ago, the resulting unemployment rate would have been 2 percentage points higher during April and May 2020 (16\% vs. 14\%), due to the lower availability of IT. Local IT adop-tion mitigates the labor market consequences of the pandemic for all individuals, regardless of gender and race, except those with the lowest level of educational attainment.},

	abstract = {The Ottoman public debt was a term which dated back to 24 August 1855, when the Ottoman Empire first entered into loan contracts with its European creditors shortly after the beginning of the Crimean War.The Empire entered into subsequent loans, partly to finance railway construction and partly to finance deficits between revenues and the lavish expenditure of the Imperial court. Some financial commentators have noted that the terms of these loans were exceptionally favourable to the French and British banks which facilitated them, whereas others have noted that the terms reflected the imperial administration's willingness to constantly refinance its debts.The Ottoman government declared a sovereign default on its loan repayments with the Ramazan Kararnamesi (Decree of Ramadan) on 30 October 1875. Six years later, as part of the Muharrem Kararnamesi (Decree of Muharrem) on 15 October 1881, which reduced the overall public debt, the Ottoman Public Debt Administration (OPDA) was established. This made the European creditors bondholders, and assigned special rights to the OPDA for collecting various tax and customs revenues within the Ottoman Empire.},

	abstract = {The Ottoman Public Debt Administration (OPDA) (Ottoman Turkish: Düyun-u Umumiye-i Osmaniye Varidat-ı Muhassasa İdaresi, or simply Düyun-u Umumiye as it was popularly known), was a European-controlled organization that was established in 1881 to collect the payments which the Ottoman Empire owed to European companies in the Ottoman public debt. The OPDA became a vast, essentially independent bureaucracy within the Ottoman bureaucracy, run by the creditors and its governing council was packed with European government officials - including one representative each from British, French, German, Austrian, Italian, Dutch, and Ottoman creditors, and one representative from the Ottoman state. It employed 5,000 officials who collected taxes that were then turned over to the European creditors. At its peak it had 9,000 employees, more than the empire’s finance ministry.The OPDA played an important role in Ottoman financial affairs. Also, it was an intermediary with European companies seeking investment opportunities in the Ottoman Empire. In 1900, the OPDA was financing many railways and other industrial projects. The financial and commercial privileges of the non-Muslim foreigners were protected with the capitulations of the Ottoman Empire.
After the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, between 1918 and 1924 Ottoman revenue stamps overprinted O.P.D.A. or A.D.P.O., or stamps printed with those inscriptions, were issued for use in Palestine, Transjordan, Syria and Lebanon.},

	abstract = {Judges are society’s elders and experts, our masters and mediators. We depend on them to dispense justice with integrity, deliberation, and efficiency. Yet judges, as Alexander Hamilton famously noted, lack the power of the purse or the sword. They must rely almost entirely on their reputations to secure compliance with their decisions, obtain resources, and maintain their political influence. In Judicial Reputation, Nuno Garoupa and Tom Ginsburg explain how reputation is not only an essential quality of the judiciary as a whole, but also of individual judges. Perceptions of judicial systems around the world range from widespread admiration to utter contempt, and as judges participate within these institutions some earn respect, while others are scorned. Judicial Reputation explores how judges respond to the reputational incentives provided by the different audiences they interact with—lawyers, politicians, the media, and the public itself—and how institutional structures mediate these interactions. The judicial structure is best understood not through the lens of legal culture or tradition, but through the economics of information and reputation. Transcending those conventional lenses, Garoupa and Ginsburg employ their long-standing research on the latter to examine the fascinating effects that governmental interactions, multicourt systems, extrajudicial work, and the international rule-of-law movement have had on the reputations of judges in this era.},

However, following Argentina's December 2001 default on its debts in which its bonds lost 70\% of their value, CACs have become much more common, as they are now seen as potentially warding off more drastic action, but enabling easier coordination of bondholders.
During the financial crisis of 2011–12, the Greek government imposed, with the support of the IMF and ECB, a retroactive CAC with a threshold of 75\%. That impacted 90\% of the bonds, which issued under the jurisdiction of Greek courts. On 9 May 2012, the required supermajority was obtained, with 85.8\% of domestic-law bonds tendered in favour. An investor named Bill Gross said, "The sanctity of their contracts is certainly lessened. Bondholders have that to look forward to going into the future," but the French Minister of Finance celebrated the deal. In the exchange, investors will receive new bonds with a face value of 31.5 percent of the old ones, together with notes from the EFSF. The new debt is governed by English law and comes with warrants that may provide extra income in years if Greek economic growth exceeds thresholds.In accordance with the treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanism, all bonds issued by Eurozone member states with maturities exceeding one year, issued after January 1, 2013, have a mandatory collective action clause.},

The analysis characterizes the defender's optimal (equilibrium) allocations in these settings, an algorithm or approach to finding the optimal allocations, and relevant comparative statics. These characterizations provide a general way of thinking about the resource-allocation problem in these settings.},

	abstract = {This paper explores when and why private communication works in crisis diplomacy. Conventional audience-cost models suggest that state leaders must go public with their threats in international crises because leaders cannot tie their hands if signals are issued privately. I present a crisis bargaining game where both the sender and the receiver of signals have a domestic audience. The equilibrium analysis demonstrates that a private threat, albeit of limited credibility, can be equally compelling as a fully credible public threat. The analysis suggests that secrecy works in crisis diplomacy despite its informational inefficacy. Secrecy insulates leaders from domestic political consequences when they capitulate to a challenge to avoid risking unwarranted war. The logic of efficient secrecy helps shed light on the unaccounted history of private diplomacy in international crises. The Alaska Boundary Dispute illustrates this logic.},

	abstract = {In many resources-allocation problems, strategic adversaries move sequentially and are likely to have private information about the effectiveness of their spending. A defender, for example, often has to allocate its defensive resources before an attacker (e.g., a terrorist group) decides where to strike. Defenders are also likely to have private information about the vulnerability of the things they are trying to protect. Sequential decisions and private information about effectiveness creates a dilemma for a defender. Allocating more to a highly vulnerable site reduces the expected losses should that site be attacked but may also signal that that site is more vulnerable and thereby increase the probability of an attack. Modeling this tradeoff as a signaling game, the analysis shows that secrecy concerns generally swamp vulnerability concerns when more vulnerable sites are weakly harder to protect on the margin. The defender pools in equilibrium, that is, allocates its resources in the same way, regardless of the level of vulnerability. If more vulnerable sites are easier to protect on the margin, vulnerability concerns may swamp secrecy concerns.},

We find that making public commitments provides bargaining leverage, when backing down from such commitments carries domestic political costs. However, when the two negotiators face fairly similar costs for violating a public commitment, a prisoner's dilemma is created in which both sides make high public demands which cannot be satisfied, and both negotiators would be better off if they could commit to not making public demands. However, making a public demand is a dominant strategy for each negotiator, and this leads to a suboptimal outcome. Escaping this prisoner's dilemma provides a rationale for secret negotiations. Testable hypotheses are derived from the nature of the commitments and agreements made in equilibrium.},

	abstract = {The severe warnings on climate change starkly documented by the IPCC report and others demonstrate why urgent action to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement is needed. The public, governments and legislators are taking notice and taking action. Much of the legislative effort to date has been focused on the financial system but there is an increasing emphasis on non-financial entities and the requirements that are beginning to be expected of them. These requirements stem from legislation, public pressure and possible litigation.This publication reflects the breadth and depth of the impact of these environmental and sustainable factors. It looks at the impact of regulatory and legislative sustainability changes on, amongst others, corporates, banks and asset managers; the rise of climate change litigation and the developments in "green" and sustainable financial products across the world.We believe the ESG and sustainability agenda must be embraced and shaped. And while we recognise that there are risks we also see opportunities for our clients. We look forward to discussing these with you.},

An in-depth analysis of all current requirements highlights twelve themes covered by multiple requirements: methodology for seabed sampling, methodology for water column sampling, statistical evidence, spatio-temporal considerations, toxicology, modelling needs, genetic studies, species-specificity, documentation and archival storage, impact-related studies, area-based management tools, and comparison and assessment. Within each theme, the relevant requirements are compared with each other to allow a comprehensive assessment of the research effort needed to satisfy all of the 100 requirements.},

We hope you have signed up for our first session with Professor William Clarke on January 28 at 6.30 PM! We are very excited for this one and we hope you are too. Please try to do the short-assigned reading(s) for the lecture which are linked in the email invite you received from Svenja for the session. You can find his bio here and can join the session here. This session will be part of the "Interactions with Academia" track of our study group. There will be one such session every 45 days roughly and we will share details soon.
We are also excited to inform you that we will be partnering with Ms. Jane Nelson, who heads Harvard's Corporate Responsibility Initiative for the "Interaction with Practioners" track of our study group. Professor Nelson is teaching a Spring 1 course on Corporate Responsibility (IGA-165M) at HKS which has a series of interactions with high level practioners. She has kindly agreed to open them up for this study group on a sign-up basis. We will be sharing details for these sessions as they are setup with sign-up links (first come first serve basis with limited spots). We would also highly recommend you signing up for the IGA-165M course and hope to see you there if you do (registration is still open).
For spring 2, we are working on lining up a few Practioner sessions and details will be shared in early March. Please provide your inputs here on speakers you would like to see and have connects with. 
Shortly, we will also send a sign-up sheet for the coffee chat series. We will match people who sign-up in pairs every month starting February and release them. We will let people setup chats at their convenience through the month to connect with their match. 

Thank you for your patience and we hope to create a great learning experience for you.Members of the B\&G PIC Corporate Responsibility Study Group, we are excited to invite you to our first event. On January 28, 2021 at 6.30PM we will host Prof. William C. Clark. As an economics trained faculty member at HKS, who focuses his work on sustainability science, Prof. Clark will introduce the notion of sustainability in the corporate context. This will be an amazing opportunity to listen and to engage in a Q\&A with a very committed faculty member, so please come prepared. Topic
Sustainable development as asset management:  What should be the contribution of responsible corporations?
 
A solid theoretical foundation for the pursuit of sustainability at the level of society as a whole has emerged over the last two decades.   This features the management of capital assets to achieve growth of inclusive metrics of society’s wealth.   The capital assets in question are both natural (mineral, biotic, and environmental capital) and anthropogenic (manufactured, human, social, and knowledge capital).   The metric for wealth is the (forecast) value to society of the asset stock.   The focus on inclusive highlights the serious attention social goals for sustainability give to equity in access to asset-based wealth – equity both within and across generations.  
 
In parallel with this maturing society-level understanding of sustainability, increasing attention has been given to the appropriate role of responsible corporations in contributing to sustainable development.   A central question in this corporation-level thinking has been how to focus capital on the longer term enhancement of appropriate “ESG” metrics.  Much progress has been made.   But the fact remains that corporate ESG targets seldom address the full range of asset stocks that theory says must be managed to conserve society’s inclusive wealth and thus to promote its sustainable development.   
Preparation1) review the state of society-level metrics for sustainable development (e.g. here: Polasky, Stephen et al., 2015. “Inclusive Wealth as a Metric of Sustainable Development.” Annual Review of Environment and Resources 40 (1): 445–66. https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-environ-101813-013253)2) come prepared to summarize the ESG metrics being used by a specific firm or sector of your choice, and to comment on how those specific metrics do or do not match the general metrics developed for society at large.How to join the meetinghttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/96039562936?pwd=dDYxakJvRWZVVUZ0SVNITFFhNytrdz09 Meeting-ID: 960 3956 2936 Code: 697413We look forward to engaging with you!Best, Saba \& Svenja},

	abstract = {Ladda Tammy Duckworth (born March 12, 1968) is an American politician and retired Army National Guard lieutenant colonel serving as the junior United States Senator from Illinois since 2017. A member of the Democratic Party, she represented Illinois's 8th district in the United States House of Representatives from 2013 to 2017.
Duckworth was educated at the University of Hawaii and George Washington University. A combat veteran of the Iraq War, she served as a U.S. Army helicopter pilot. In 2004, after her helicopter was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade fired by Iraqi insurgents, she suffered severe combat wounds, which caused her to lose both of her legs and some mobility in her right arm. She was the first female double amputee from the war. Despite her grievous injuries, she sought and obtained a medical waiver that allowed her to continue serving in the Illinois Army National Guard until she retired as a lieutenant colonel in 2014.
Duckworth ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the United States House of Representatives in 2006, then served as Director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs from 2006 to 2009 and as Assistant Secretary for Public and Intergovernmental Affairs at the United States Department of Veterans Affairs from 2009 to 2011. In 2012, Duckworth was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where she served two terms. Duckworth was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2016, defeating Republican incumbent Mark Kirk. She is the first Thai American woman elected to Congress, the first person born in Thailand elected to Congress, the first woman with a disability elected to Congress, the first female double amputee in the Senate, and the first senator to give birth while in office. Duckworth is the second of three Asian American woman to serve in the U.S. Senate, after Mazie Hirono, and before Kamala Harris.},

Kirk calls himself a social liberal and fiscal conservative.Born in Champaign, Illinois, Kirk graduated from Cornell University, the London School of Economics, and Georgetown University Law Center. He practiced law throughout the 1980s and 1990s. He joined the United States Navy Reserve as a Direct Commission Officer in the Intelligence career field in 1989 and was recalled to active duty for the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. He participated in Operation Northern Watch in Iraq the following year. He attained the rank of Commander and retired from the Navy Reserve in 2013.Kirk was elected to the House in 2000. During his fifth term in November 2010, he won two concurrent elections: to finish the final months of former Senator Barack Obama's term and to serve the next six-year term. He was sworn in on November 29, 2010 and began a six-year Senate term on January 3, 2011. In January 2012, Kirk suffered a stroke; a full year passed before he returned to his senatorial duties.

The apportionment of seats in this House of Representatives was based on the Nineteenth Census of the United States in 1970. Both chambers had a Democratic majority. It was the first time either party held a filibuster-proof 60\% super majority in both the Senate and House chambers since the 89th United States Congress in 1965, and last time until the 111th United States Congress in 2009. All three super majorities were Democratic party and also were accompanied by Democratic Presidents. As of 2020, this is the most recent Congress to approve an amendment (the unratified District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment) to the Constitution.},

	abstract = {Project MKUltra (or MK-Ultra), also called the CIA mind control program, is the code name given to a program of experiments on human subjects that were designed and undertaken by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, some of which were illegal. Experiments on humans were intended to identify and develop drugs and procedures to be used in interrogations in order to weaken the individual and force confessions through mind control. The project was organized through the Office of Scientific Intelligence of the CIA and coordinated with the United States Army Biological Warfare Laboratories. Other code names for drug-related experiments were Project Bluebird and Project Artichoke.The operation was officially sanctioned in 1953, reduced in scope in 1964 and further curtailed in 1967. It was officially halted in 1973. The program also engaged in illegal activities, including the use of U.S. and Canadian citizens as its unwitting test subjects, which led to controversy regarding its legitimacy. MKUltra used numerous methods to manipulate its subjects' mental states and brain functions. Techniques included the covert administration of high doses of psychoactive drugs (especially LSD) and other chemicals, electroshocks, hypnosis, sensory deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse, as well as other forms of torture.The scope of Project MKUltra was broad, with research undertaken at more than 80 institutions, including colleges and universities, hospitals, prisons, and pharmaceutical companies. The CIA operated using front organizations, although sometimes top officials at these institutions were aware of the CIA's involvement.Project MKUltra was first brought to public attention in 1975 by the Church Committee of the United States Congress and Gerald Ford's United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States (also known as the Rockefeller Commission).
Investigative efforts were hampered by CIA Director Richard Helms's order that all MKUltra files be destroyed in 1973; the Church Committee and Rockefeller Commission investigations relied on the sworn testimony of direct participants and on the relatively small number of documents that survived Helms's destruction order. In 1977, a Freedom of Information Act request uncovered a cache of 20,000 documents relating to project MKUltra which led to Senate hearings later that year. Some surviving information regarding MKUltra was declassified in July 2001. In December 2018, declassified documents included a letter to an unidentified doctor discussing work on six dogs made to run, turn and stop via remote control and brain implants.},

Following amendments made in 1998, the Act also applies to foreign firms and persons who, either directly or through intermediaries, help facilitate or carry out corrupt payments in U.S. territory.Pursuant to its anti-bribery purpose, the FCPA amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to require all companies with securities listed in the U.S. to meet certain accounting provisions, such as ensuring accurate and transparent financial records and maintaining internal accounting controls.The FCPA is jointly enforced by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which apply criminal and civil penalties, respectively.Since its passage, the FCPA has been subject to controversy and criticism, namely whether its enforcement discourages U.S. companies from investing abroad. The Act was subsequently amended in 1988 to raise the standard of proof for a finding of bribery.},

	abstract = {In many resources-allocation problems, strategic adversaries move sequentially and are likely to have private information about the effectiveness of their spending. A defender, for example, often has to allocate its defensive resources before an attacker (e.g., a terrorist group) decides where to strike. Defenders are also likely to have private information about the vulnerability of the things they are trying to protect. Sequential decisions and private information about effectiveness creates a dilemma for a defender. Allocating more to a highly vulnerable site reduces the expected losses should that site be attacked but may also signal that that site is more vulnerable and thereby increase the probability of an attack. Modeling this tradeoff as a signaling game, the analysis shows that secrecy concerns generally swamp vulnerability concerns when more vulnerable sites are weakly harder to protect on the margin. The defender pools in equilibrium, that is, allocates its resources in the same way, regardless of the level of vulnerability. If more vulnerable sites are easier to protect on the margin, vulnerability concerns may swamp secrecy concerns.},

The analysis characterizes the defender's optimal (equilibrium) allocations in these settings, an algorithm or approach to finding the optimal allocations, and relevant comparative statics. These characterizations provide a general way of thinking about the resource-allocation problem in these settings.},

	abstract = {We use a formal bargaining model to examine why, in many domestic and international bargaining situations, one or both negotiators make public statements in front of their constituents committing themselves to obtaining certain benefits in the negotiations. We find that making public commitments provides bargaining leverage, when backing down from such commitments carries domestic political costs. However, when the two negotiators face fairly similar costs for violating a public commitment, a prisoner's dilemma is created in which both sides make high public demands which cannot be satisfied, and both negotiators would be better off if they could commit to not making public demands. However, making a public demand is a dominant strategy for each negotiator, and this leads to a suboptimal outcome. Escaping this prisoner's dilemma provides a rationale for secret negotiations. Testable hypotheses are derived from the nature of the commitments and agreements made in equilibrium.},

	abstract = {This paper explores when and why private communication works in crisis diplomacy. Conventional audience-cost models suggest that state leaders must go public with their threats in international crises because leaders cannot tie their hands if signals are issued privately. I present a crisis bargaining game where both the sender and the receiver of signals have a domestic audience. The equilibrium analysis demonstrates that a private threat, albeit of limited credibility, can be equally compelling as a fully credible public threat. The analysis suggests that secrecy works in crisis diplomacy despite its informational inefficacy. Secrecy insulates leaders from domestic political consequences when they capitulate to a challenge to avoid risking unwarranted war. The logic of efficient secrecy helps shed light on the unaccounted history of private diplomacy in international crises. The Alaska Boundary Dispute illustrates this logic.},

We also find that higher social unrest, in turn, is associated with lower ourput and higher inequality, pointing to a vicious cycle. Our results suggest that without policy measures, the COVID-19 pandemic will likely increase inequality, trigger social unrest, and lower future output in the years to come.},

	abstract = {Scholars from diverse fields increasingly rely on high-frequency spatio-temporal data. Yet, causal inference with these data remains challenging due to spatial spillover and temporal carryover effects. We develop methods to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects by allowing for arbitrary spatial and temporal causal dependencies. We focus on common settings where the treatment and outcomes are time-varying spatial point patterns and where moderators are either spatial or spatio-temporal variables. We define causal estimands based on stochastic interventions where researchers specify counterfactual distributions of treatment events. We propose the H´ajek-type estimator of the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) as a function of spatiotemporal moderator variables, and establish its asymptotic normality as the number of time periods increases. We then introduce a statistical test of no heterogeneous treatment effects. Through simulations, we evaluate the finite-sample performance of the proposed CATE estimator and its inferential properties. Our motivating application examines the heterogeneous effects of US airstrikes on insurgent violence in Iraq. Drawing on declassified spatio-temporal data, we examine how prior aid distributions moderate airstrike effects. Contrary to expectations from counterinsurgency theories, we find that prior aid distribution, along with greater amounts of aid per capita, is associated with increased insurgent attacks following airstrikes.},

	abstract = {Social scientists now routinely draw on high-frequency, high-granularity “microlevel” data to estimate the causal effects of subnational interventions. To date, most researchers aggregate these data into panels, often tied to large-scale administrative units. This approach has two limitations. First, data (over)aggregation obscures valuable spatial and temporal information, heightening the risk of mistaken inferences. Second, existing panel approaches either ignore spatial spillover and temporal carryover effects completely or impose overly restrictive assumptions. We introduce a general methodological framework and an accompanying open-source R package, geocausal, that enable spatiotemporal causal inference with arbitrary spillover and carryover effects. Using this framework, we demonstrate how to define and estimate causal quantities of interest, explore heterogeneous treatment effects, conduct causal mediation analysis, and perform data visualization. We apply our methodology to the Iraq War (2003–11), where we reexamine long-standing questions about the effects of airstrikes on insurgent violence.},

Simulation studies suggest that while the regret-regression approach is most efﬁcient when there is no model misspeciﬁcation, in the presence of misspeciﬁcation the efﬁcient g-estimation procedure is more robust. The g-estimation method can be difﬁcult to apply in complex circumstances, however.

The combination of these analytic tools allows us to not only quantify some of the effects of drone strikes, but also to compare them to other shocks. We find that on average drone strikes leave a footprint in their aftermath, spurring significant but localized spikes in communication. This suggests that drone strikes are not a purely surgical intervention, but rather have a disruptive impact on the local population.},

	abstract = {Given the unconfoundedness assumption, we propose new nonparametric estimators for the reduced dimensional conditional average treatment effect (CATE) function. In the first stage, the nuisance functions necessary for identifying CATE are estimated by machine learning methods, allowing the number of covariates to be comparable to or larger than the sample size. The second stage consists of a low-dimensional local linear regression, reducing CATE to a function of the covariate(s) of interest. We consider two variants of the estimator depending on whether the nuisance functions are estimated over the full sample or over a hold-out sample. Building on Belloni at al. and Chernozhukov et al., we derive functional limit theory for the estimators and provide an easy-to-implement procedure for uniform inference based on the multiplier bootstrap. The empirical application revisits the effect of maternal smoking on a baby’s birth weight as a function of the mother’s age.},

	abstract = {We are interested in estimating the average effect of a binary treatment on a scalar outcome. If assignment to the treatment is exogenous or unconfounded, that is, independent of the potential outcomes given covariates, biases associated with simple treatment-control average comparisons can be removed by adjusting for differences in the covariates. Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) show that adjusting solely for differences between treated and control units in the propensity score removes all biases associated with differences in covariates. Although adjusting for differences in the propensity score removes all the bias, this can come at the expense of efficiency, as shown by Hahn (1998), Heckman, Ichimura, and Todd (1998), and Robins, Mark, and Newey (1992). We show that weighting by the inverse of a nonparametric estimate of the propensity score, rather than the true propensity score, leads to an efficient estimate of the average treatment effect. We provide intuition for this result by showing that this estimator can be interpreted as an empirical likelihood estimator that efficiently incorporates the information about the propensity score.},

	abstract = {This article analyzes the causal relationship between terrorism and economic growth, running a series of tests for Granger non–causality with panel data for a maximum of 160 countries from 1970 to 2007. The authors find that the causal relationship between terrorism and growth is heterogeneous over time and across space. They argue that the temporal causal heterogeneity can be explained by shifting geographical and ideological patterns in terrorism associated with the end of the Cold War. Different causal mechanics across countries are ascribed to a variety of country–specific factors (the level of politico–economic development, a country’s cultural affiliation, the intensity and persistence of terrorist activity, and the level of political instability). These factors govern a country’s robustness to shocks from terrorism and the extent to which terrorism is motivated by economic factors. For the Cold War era, economic growth is found to have swayed terrorism for Latin American countries in intermediate development positions that were politically unstable and experienced strong terrorist activity. For the post–Cold War era, terrorism is found to be detrimental to growth for African and Islamic countries with low levels of political openness, high levels of political instability, and strong terrorist activity. The study’s findings help to better understand the conflicting evidence on the terrorism–economy nexus and to give more solid counter-terrorism advice.},

A DTR is a set of decision rules, one per interval of treatment, where each decision is a function of treatment and covariate history that returns a recommended treatment. Q-learning is a popular method from the reinforcement learning literature that has recently been applied to estimate DTRs. While, in principle, Q-learning can be used for both randomized and observational data, the focus in the literature thus far has been exclusively on the randomized treatment setting. We extend the method to incorporate measured confounding covariates, using direct adjustment and a variety of propensity score approaches. The methods are examined under various settings including non-regular scenarios. We illustrate the methods in examining the effect of breastfeeding on vocabulary testing, based on data from the Promotion of Breastfeeding Intervention Trial.

Yet the classic causal inference framework is not directly applicable when the treatment and outcome variables are generated by spatio-temporal point processes. We extend the potential outcomes framework to these settings by formulating the treatment point process as a stochastic intervention. Our causal estimands include the expected number of outcome events in a specified area under a particular stochastic treatment assignment strategy. Our methodology allows for arbitrary patterns of spatial spillover and temporal carryover effects. Using martingale theory, we show that the proposed estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal as the number of time periods increases. We propose a sensitivity analysis for the possible existence of unmeasured confounders, and extend it to the Hájek estimator. Simulation studies are conducted to examine the estimators’ finite sample performance. Finally, we illustrate the proposed methods by estimating the effects of American airstrikes on insurgent violence in Iraq from February 2007 to July 2008. Our analysis suggests that increasing the average number of daily airstrikes for up to 1 month may result in more insurgent attacks. We also find some evidence that airstrikes can displace attacks from Baghdad to new locations up to 400 km away.},
